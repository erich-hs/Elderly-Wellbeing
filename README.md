<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

“Well-being has been defined as the combination of feeling good and functioning well; the experience of positive emotions
such as happiness and contentment as well as the development of one’s potential, having some control over one’s life,
having a sense of purpose, and experiencing positive relationships” (Ruggeri et al., 2020).

This term of well-being is linked directly to positive mental health, meaning that it is linked to one’s success at the
professional, personal, and interpersonal levels. 

### Aim
- To identify the main focuses and concerns that communities in British Columbia, and to a greater extent, Canada, raised
in the last 2 years during the pandemic.

- To identify how the well-being of the elderly aligns with those concerns.

### Research Questions
-	Among the academic society, what research has been conducted in the context of the elderly’s well-being? This question
relates to the geographical location, and cultural and socio-economic contexts.
-	What topics have been discussed in the context of the elderly’s well-being in social media fora?
-	What topics have been discussed in the context of the elderly’s well-being in the general media?
-	How do perceptions of well-being from the social and general media align with the existing literature?
-	What is the general public mentioning in Twitter about the well-being and happiness among seniors in B.C.?
-	What are the common combinations of topics in relation to the different indicators for measuring well-being among
seniors?

## About this Repository

Through this repository the team will mantain the web-scraping and machine learning sections of this project, as well as
scraped data. All of the scraping and tools utilized in the project are in accordance with the websites and social medias
policies.

### Data Scraping

Twitter API v2.0 was used with requested Academic Research access. All data contained in this repository was studied in aggregate, where statistical inferences and visualizations were made in disregard of individual analysis of isolated tweets.

## Dashboard

A [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/erich6116/viz/Elderly_Well-being_online/Elderly_Well-being) was developed to present the initial topic modeling and sentiment analysis results of Twitter data. The dashboard alongside an informational banner about the adopted methodology was exhibited at the 2022 Langara's Applied Research Day fair. The project was **awarded the prize for the presentation that best communicates the project**.

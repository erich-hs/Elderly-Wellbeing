## About The Project

“Well-being has been defined as the combination of feeling good and functioning well; the experience of positive emotions
such as happiness and contentment as well as the development of one’s potential, having some control over one’s life,
having a sense of purpose, and experiencing positive relationships” (Ruggeri et al., 2020).

This term of well-being is linked directly to positive mental health, meaning that it is linked to one’s success at the
professional, personal, and interpersonal levels. 

### Aim
- To identify the main focuses and concerns that communities in British Columbia, and to a greater extent, Canada, raised
in the last 2 years during the pandemic.

- To identify how the well-being of the elderly aligns with those concerns.

### Research Questions
-	Among the academic society, what research has been conducted in the context of the elderly’s well-being? This question
relates to the geographical location, and cultural and socio-economic contexts.
-	What topics have been discussed in the context of the elderly’s well-being in social media fora?
-	What topics have been discussed in the context of the elderly’s well-being in the general media?
-	How do perceptions of well-being from the social and general media align with the existing literature?
-	What is the general public mentioning in Twitter about the well-being and happiness among seniors in B.C.?
-	What are the common combinations of topics in relation to the different indicators for measuring well-being among
seniors?

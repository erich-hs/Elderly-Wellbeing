B.C. Seniors Advocate, Isobel Mackenzie is asking the Province to declare that every resident in long term care is entitled to designate at least one person as their essential visitor.  While we can all understand the need to limit the number of visitors to long-term care during this latest wave of COVID-19, returning to essential visitors without declaring that every resident is entitled to at least one essential visitor has effectively left the majority of long-term care residents without visits from loved ones, said Mackenzie.  In November 2020, the Office of the Seniors Advocate (OSA) issued the report Staying Apart to Stay Safe: The Impact of Visit Restrictions on Long-Term Care and Assisted Living Survey, which highlighted the impact of visitor restrictions on residents and their family members. In this report, OSA identified that 52% of requests made by residents to designate an essential visitor were denied. The Seniors Advocate issued the recommendation in this report that all residents be provided the opportunity to designate an essential visitor.   To date, no changes have been made to the process for determining if a resident meets the criteria to be designated an essential visitor. The determination is made by the administrator of the care facility on a case-by-case basis. Essentials visits can include, but are not limited to:  Visits for compassionate care, including critical illness, palliative care, hospice care, end of life, and Medical Assistance in Dying  -being, including assistance with feeding, mobility, and personal care  Communication assistance for persons with hearing, visual, speech, cognitive, intellectual or memory impairments  Assistance by designated representatives for persons with disabilities  Visits for supported decision making   receiving phone calls and emails from family members, including spouses, who were advised they could no longer visit their loved one, even though they offer vital support and care. They help to feed their loved one, get them dressed, take them for walks, and keep them engaged. For many residents, these visitors are the only people who can motivate them to engage in any activities, and yet they are not formally recognized as essential,  Current public health orders allow essential visitors to continue to visit if an outbreak is declared at a facility while social visit suspended for the duration of the outbreak. Prior to visiting, all visitors to long-term care facility must be fully vaccinated and rapid antigen tests are administered. are home operators are significantly over-burdened. They need the clarity from the province that every resident is entitled to an essential visitor and be relieved of the staff resources required to manage the essential visitor designation process. As B.C. faces its most prolific wave of this pandemic, care homes need to plan for staff absences of up to 30%, and we know that the care provided to residents by essential visitors can help manage an overburdened care home. I urge the province to empower residents in long-term care to choose a designated essential visitor, as it is only the resident and their families who truly know who is essential to their health and well-being,concluded Mackenzie   Media Contact: OSA Communications P: 250-213-2024  E: osa.comms@gov.bc.ca"

Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie  British Columbia is currently experiencing a fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic fueled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. In response, public health officials have undertaken several new measures to blunt the potential of this wave to overtake our health care system. These public health restrictions limit the opportunities for transmission and large outbreaks, accelerate the vaccine booster schedule, and expand the provincial testing strategy to include further use of rapid antigen tests to compliment the use of PCR testing. Together, these measures along with the use of masks and the BC Vaccine Card, will hopefully reduce the severity of the fifth wave. I ask every British Columbian to continue to follow the public heath guidelines to protect our vulnerable seniors. While COVID-19 can cause severe illness and death at any age, those aged seventy and older in B.C. have been disproportionately impacted. Since the pandemic began, those aged seventy and older who contracted COVID-19 were 22 times more likely to die than people who were younger, and those aged eighty and older were 44 times more likely to die.   Frail seniors living in long-term care suffered significantly in the first two waves of the pandemic from the virus and visit restrictions. In response, measures to protect our seniors in long term care have been put in place, including mandatory vaccination for staff and visitors, and booster shots for residents and staff. The province has also expanded its rapid testing program for long-term care staff and visitors, providing an additional layer of protection for seniors and their loved ones.  In order to protect the seniors in our communities, as the majority of seniors aged seventy and older still live in their own home, we must limit our exposure to others and keep our circles small during this current wave. In order to allow seniors in the community to safely have contact with loved ones, rapid antigen tests should be available for at-home use to protect this vulnerable population.   Today, I am asking the provincial government to make rapid antigen tests (RAT) available in the community, so that individuals may test themselves prior to visiting their loved ones who are elderly and at highest risk of severe illness. Additionally, I am also asking any members of the public who have secured their own supply of RATs to use them wisely and prioritize usage of the tests for visits with elderly or clinically extremely vulnerable loved ones.  I am also asking that the government, in conjunction with its accelerated booster shot schedule, reduce the current third dose/booster. This change reflects the current reality of British Columbia as we face a pandemic with the highly transmissible Omicron variant.  In the meantime, I strongly encourage everyone to book their third dose/booster shot as soon as possible. Now more than ever, this third shot is critical in our management of the pandemic. And for those who have not yet been vaccinated, I implore you to do so immediately. Vaccines not only protect you, but also those around you and our communities at large.  The past two years have been difficult for everyone, but British Columbians have shown they will do the right thing to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their community. Every day I hear stories of people helping seniors, such as getting groceries or medications and checking in by having a friendly chat. To all those who have lent a hand over this pandemic, I say a profound thank you.  As we near the end of another challenging year, I join so many others in offering my heartfelt thanks to our health care workers. Every front-line worker has my sincere gratitude.  While this is not the holiday season we were all hoping for, if we follow public health guidelines, we can find a way to safely spend time with some of our loved ones. My best wishes for the holiday season to everyone.   Isobel Mackenzie Seniors Advocate Province of British Columbia   Contact: osa.comms@gov.bc.ca 236-478-2026"

The average length of stay in long term care was 2.5 years (900 days), a 7% increase over the previous year, while the median length of stay at 555 days increased by 14%.   On average, care facilities were funded to deliver 3.37 hours of direct care per resident per day and the number of facilities meeting the 3.36 guideline increased from 50% to 83%.   The average food cost increased by 6% (range $5.79-$18.75 per resident/day, average $8.87), while the per diem rate paid to facilities increased by 5% on average (range $206.60-$309.89 per resident/day, average $242.90).   An overall five-year trend of decreased rates of physical, occupational, and recreational therapy continued.   The rate of falls at 13% of residents and pressure ulcers at 2% of residents remained relatively unchanged year over year. Compared to 2019/20, the rate of substantiated complaints per 1,000 beds decreased 25% and the reportable incidents per 100 beds (49.0) decreased by 26% from the previous year. These reductions may be related in large part to the decrease in inspections and the focus on COVID-19 pandemic measures.    The release of the Directory also corresponds with the launch of the new website for the Office of the Seniors Advocate. The new website includes the updated Long-Term Care Directory, featuring an interactive map of all publicly funded long-term care facilities in British Columbia. The interactive map and updated directory include information such as the address, phone number, health authority, room configuration, total number of beds, and quality indicators. This updated directory and webpage will allow seniors, their family members, their caregivers, and key stakeholders to efficiently navigate the long-term care facilities in British Columbia.  -Term Care Directory, seniors and their loved ones will be able to access vital information to help them make informed decisions; and advocates and stakeholders will be able to monitor developing trends and areas of improvement in long-Mackenzie.

Seniors Advocate Releases Review of COVD-19 Outbreaks in Care Homes   VICTORIA  Today, Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie released the results of a province-wide review of COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care and assisted living sites during the first year of the pandemic. The review examined factors that can influence the probability that a site will experience a COVID-19 outbreak and factors that can minimize the number of staff and residents who become infected when an outbreak occurs.   -19 can spread in long-term care and assisted living sites, and we saw the devastating impact of this virus on the older population. , we have tragically lost over 800 residents to COVID-19,This is not just a set of numbers, these are people. Residents and their family members had their lives upended with the trauma of life in long-term care and assisted living during a pandemic, and those who operate and work in these care homes have been deeply affected by the experience.   The review examined 365 outbreaks at 210 sites for the period of March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021 and found:  84% of outbreaks occurred at sites in the lower mainland  72% of outbreaks were contained to four or fewer cases  75% of outbreaks had no COVID-19 fatalities with an overall case fatality rate of 30%  87% of outbreaks were experienced in Wave 2 (September 2020 to February 2021)  Data collected was used to examine the physical characteristics of each site, the specific characteristics of its residents and staff, and the specifics of each outbreak to identify factors that might have contributed to an outbreak occurring and/or spreading to more staff and residents. In most outbreaks (76%), the first COVID-19 case was a staff member. In 22% of outbreaks, a resident was the first case and there was only one outbreak where the confirmed first case was a visitor. The report identifies that a site was more likely to have a large outbreak:  if the first case was a resident (four times more likely)  if the first case was a nightshift worker (five times more likely)  if the first case was a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (1.5 times more likely)  The report also identifies that fast notification of the first case and testing staff within the first 48 hours were more likely to contain an outbreak and 40% of outbreaks that had not tested all staff by the fourth day grew into larger outbreaks. The review analyzed what factors were more common in larger outbreaks and found:  sites that provided fewer days of paid sick leave were more likely to experience a larger outbreaks (while almost all sites provide paid sick leave to staff, the number of days ranged from 2.5 to 18 days per year)  sites with lower levels of registered nurses as a proportion of the direct care hours were more likely to experience large outbreaks  sites that had shared rooms were more likely to experience a larger outbreak  Overall, the probability of experiencing any outbreak (defined as one test-positive case in either staff or residents) was most closely associated with the level of local community transmission of COVID-19.  The review included feedback from over 6,500 staff who reported they were concerned about infecting residents and their own family members, and reported their overall health and wellbeing was compromised by the experience of working through the pandemic. Overtime increased by 63%, with sites that experienced a large outbreak increasing overtime by 178%. A total of 2.3 million hours of overtime was delivered during the year.   As well, site operators experienced significant increases in workloads related to managing staff, families of residents, supplies and health authority officials.  The review highlighted that B.C. performed significantly better than Ontario in Wave 1 likely a result of both lower rates of community transmission and the early protection measures taken in long-term care and assisted living in B.C. In Wave 2, after Ontario adopted the same measures as B.C., the percentage of overall COVID-19 cases in long-term care was the same for the two provinces.   The report includes seven recommendations:  1. Increase paid sick leave for staff 2. Increase the pool of direct care staff  3. Decrease contracting for direct care staff 4. Increase levels of registered nursing staff as a proportion of direct care staff 5. Increase testing scope, timeliness and frequency 6. Eliminate shared rooms 7. Require staff of long-term care to be vaccinated and provide booster shots to residents    The complete report is available at www.seniorsadvocatebc.ca/osa-reports/covid-outbreak-review-report  Media contact: Gabrielle Parent osa.comms@gov.bc.ca 236-478-2026 Backgrounder:    There are 355 long-term care sites (34,899 beds) and 132 assisted living sites (4,954 units) in B.C. covered by public health orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

These annual reports offer a comprehensive picture of the supports and services offered to B.C. seniors and their families, comparing trends and previous performance in an effort to identify program successes and continuing gaps. Updated data is presented on a wide range of services including health care, hospitalizations, housing, transportation, income supports, affordability, taxation and elder abuse.  Among the key findings in this year™s reports:   The population 65 and over increased 4% in the last year. In the past 10 years the proportion of the B.C. population 65 plus has increased 27%, however, the proportion 85 plus has remained relatively stable at 2% of the population.   The overall health of B.C. seniors remains relatively stable and with more significant chronic conditions and health care utilization at age 85 plus.  The majority of B.C. seniors (94%) continue to live independently in their own home. Overall, 3% of seniors live in long-term care and 3% live in seniors independent/assisted living. This has remained stable over the past five years.   Emergency department and hospitalization rates for those over 65 increased relative to the population increase and although the length of stay has continued to decline, there was a 5% increase in alternative length of stay (ALC) cases after two years of only marginal increases.   The long-term care (LTC) bed rate per 1,000 of population age 85 plus has decreased 9% in the last five years and a variety of measures show increased wait times for long-term care in the past year: clients on the wait list increased 27% ( total 2,259), the average time on the waitlist increased by 3% (133 days), the average wait time of 52 days for clients admitted to long-term care is an increase of 37% and the number admitted within 30 days decreased 11%.    Overall, there was a 67% increase in the number of LTC homes funded for 3.36 hours of care, the most significant annual increase to date.   Overall, the age and complexity characteristics of residents in LTC remains unchanged and has been stable over the past five years.  Progress has been made in reducing falls with injury in LTC but have stalled on the goal of reducing the use of antipsychotics.  Overall, there was an 17% increase in the number of substantiated complaints to licensing.  85% of long-term care residents and 69% of staff were vaccinated for influenza, a decrease of 2% for residents and a decrease of 5% for staff. 2   The Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (S.A.F.E.R) saw a 3% increase in the number of recipients, on pace with the growth in the target population, while rental rates increased 4% on average. The rental cap for S.A.F.E.R. remained unchanged.  For the first time in four years, the number of seniors subsidized housing units increased, however, the waitlist increased by 11% and the median wait time for a unit increased 13%.  The Property Tax Deferment program continues to grow, with an increase of 10% in 2019/20.   The majority of seniors (79%) maintain an active driver™s licence and 75,300 seniors age 80 and over were screened for the driver medical fitness. This past year saw an 18% decrease in the number of over 80 drivers referred to a road assessment (6% in total referred).  There was a 7% increase in the number of seniors using the BC Bus Pass.  The rate of inflation in B.C. was higher than the Canadian average putting a further strain on federal income supports such as OAS/GIS and CPP.  Calls related to elder abuse increased 17% in 2019. The Seniors Abuse and Information Line (SAIL) received 5,558 calls in 2019, an increase of 27% since 2018Š28% were related to abuse, 46% to non-abuse matters, and 26% were for general information.   It is important to note that the serious impacts of COVID-19 are not included in this data, which relates to fiscal 2019/20. Many of the indicators affected by COVID-19 will be represented in next year™s reports.  ﬁThe number of seniors continues to grow in British Columbia and monitoring the services they depend upon is a key function of this office. As British Columbians, our challenge is ensuring important services are working as intended and reaching the people who need them most,ﬂ said Mackenzie.

Seniors Advocate Releases Results of Province-wide Survey   Victoria, B.C. Today, British Columbia Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie released the results of a province-wide survey on the impact of visit restrictions at long-term care and assisted living homes. The report, Staying Apart to Stay Safe, reflects the experience of more than 13,000 residents and their family members over the course of the current pandemic.    we face,long-term care and assisted living homes because we care about the seniors who live there, and we want to keep them safe. But as we enter our ninth month, British Columbia seniors and their families are seeking a better balance between preventing the transmission of COVID-19 and ensuring quality of   Calls, letters and emails on the issue of visit restrictions have dominated the Office of the Seniors Advocate more than any other single issue in its history. Many of the stories detail the negative impact of limited visits or no visits, with some residents and their family members expressing more fear about loneliness than contracting COVID-19.  The report highlights that when COVID-19 first struck care homes, the Province acted swiftly and decisively, bringing in a number of prevention measures that have seen B.C. perform relatively well in managing COVID-19 in long-term care and assisted living.   and comprehensive actions at the beginning of this  Mackenzie. any lives were undoubtedly saved. However, residents and family members now recognize the pandemic will continue for many more months, and the survey makes it clear they are asking for more time with their loved ones  , the goal was to ensure residents in long-term care and assisted living were kept safe from COVID-19. Eight months later, we need to ask the question: What are we keeping them safe for if it is not to enjoy the time they have left with the ones they love? While COVID-19 has tragically claimed the lives of 151 residents of long-term care and assisted living more than 4,500 other residents have died from something other than COVID-19 during this pandemic and in many cases, they spent their final months, weeks and days in relative isolation, unable to spend time with those they loved most,continued Mackenzie. The survey generated over 13,000 valid responses from all parts of the province. In a series of questions covering visits before the pandemic, during the first phase of visit restrictions, and currently, the survey found:  Before the pandemic, 55% of families were visiting long-term care and assisted living residents for an hour or more several times per week and even daily;  Prior to COVID-19, the majority of visitors were performing essential care for residents, such as personal care, grooming, assistance with feeding and mobilization;  Most family members were not aware of the possibility of essential visits during the first four months of visit restrictions, and almost half of the people who did apply for an essential visit were refused;  Under the current visitation policy, the majority of visits are only once a week or less, and half the visits in long-term care are 30 minutes or less;  30% of current visits are outside only;  Currently, 65% of visits are observed by staff for some or all of the time;  -term care residents and almost 100% of assisted living residents live in private rooms);  70% of visitors are not allowed to touch their loved one;  Most visitors are washing their hands, wearing a mask, having their temperature checked, and answering health questions prior to each visit; and  Most family members and residents support some visit restrictions during the pandemic, although they believe visits should be more frequent and that at least one more visitor for each resident should be permitted.  The report also highlights data that points to signs of negative health impacts on residents. Of concern to the Seniors Advocate is the substantial increase in the use of antipsychotic medication during the period of visit restrictions and clinical assessments completed in the first quarter that show an increase in unexplained weight loss and worsening of mood or symptoms of depression.  The report also highlights the need for residents and family members to have a collective voice in the decision-making process and makes three recommendations:   1. Allow all residents to designate an essential care partner; 2. Allow social visitors and determine the number allowed by balancing the risk of COVID-19 with the risk to a residents health from the long-term family separations; 3. Create a provincial association of long-term care and assisted living resident and family councils.

The review found:  financial reporting systems were inconsistent between health authorities and they lacked openness and transparency  there was insufficient detail for significant expenditures related to management fees, head office allocation and some administrative costs  the method to report direct care hours was based on self-reported unaudited expense reports prepared by the care home operators with no ability to verify the reported worked hours  less than half of care home operators are required to make their audited financial statements available to the public and no care homes publicly report their expense statements  Overall the contracted long-term care sector:  generated $1.4 billion in revenue of which $1.3 billion came from public funding  Spent 54% of revenue for direct care staff, the single largest expenditure  Spent 15% of revenue on building costs  Generated a net profit of $37 million The review found that expenditures and profits were not evenly distributed between care homes and there was a distinct difference based on type of ownership:    care homes in the not-for profit sector spent 59% of revenues on direct care versus 49% in the for-profit sector  not-for-profit care homes spent 9% of revenue on building expenses versus 20% in the for-profit sector   for-profit care homes generated 12 times the amount of profit generated in the not-for-profit sector, $34.4 million versus $2.8 million 2  The report found that while receiving, on average, the same level of public funding:  not-for-profit care homes spend $10,000 or 24% more per year on care for each resident  for-profit care homes failed to deliver 207,000 funded direct care hours  not-for-profit care homes exceeded direct care hour targets by delivering an additional 80,000 hours of direct care beyond what they were publicly funded to deliver The review found that for-profit care homes have lower costs than not-for-profit care homes for each worked hour of direct care across all direct care classifications and care aide wages in for-profit care homes can be paid as much as 28% or $6.63 less per hour than the industry standard. of for-profit operators paying lower wages, the degree to which this is impacting their ability to recruit said Mackenzie. The review also found problems with building costs, particularly capital building costs that are publicly funded through payments to the operator. We fund over $200 million a year for building costs across the sector but we do not attempt to determine if the taxpayer is receiving good value for money and paying fair market rates said Mackenzie.  The review found a lack of detail for how operators engage with related businesses as there was no requirement for them to declare if they have a financial interest in a company they contract with to supply goods or services to their publicly funded care home. There was no requirement for operators to declare if they were receiving executive compensation in addition to reported profits.  The report produced five recommendations.

Seniors Advocate, Isobel Mackenzie, today released the Monitoring Seniors Services 2019 (MSS 2019) report. The report, published annually, measures the performance of senior services across health care, housing, transportation, income supports, and personal supports.  The MSS 2019 report provides a comprehensive picture of the services being offered to B.C. seniors and highlights some of the gaps in those services. Over the past five years, it has become clear that the province needs better data when it comes to information on the magnitude or root causes of elder abuse and  ve work to do in terms of increasing our vaccination rates among seniors, and among the public as well. The public health data is clear: vaccine efficacy diminishes with age he best protection for frail and elderly seniors is not only the vaccination of seniors, but of the people  There is mixed progress on home supports. We saw progress on short-term home support clients, and that is directly linked to the reduced length of stay in hospitals; however, we fell behind a little on the client count for long-term home support and hopefully this will be a focus in the coming year.  While the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) program is offering more subsidy to more seniors, there is a worrisome trend developing in the number of seniors subsidized housing units. There was also positive news this year. The government made a commitment to invest in Adult Day Programs. The results of those investments are now visible, with a 10% increase in clients for Adult Day Programs and a 1This is welcomed news for many families who can now find some respite for themselves, and some needed company for their loved ones.  Highlights from the report:  The proportion of the seniors population grew from 14% in 2008 to 18% in 2018; those aged 75-84 and 85 or older have remained at 5% and 2% since 2008.  The distribution of the seniors population is not consistent across the province with the percentage of seniors ranging from a high of 24% on Vancouver Island to a low of 13% in Northern Health.   37% of seniors received the publicly funded flu vaccine; 87% of long-term care residents and 74% of staff were vaccinated.  Marked improvement in the access to Adult Day Programs with 10% more clients and a 1.5% reduction in the waitlist. NEWS RELEASE  Short-term home support experienced an increase in clients, which links to the reduction of the average length of stay in hospitals; however, long-term home supports saw a decrease in both the number of clients and in the average hours per client.  Long-term care experienced increases in wait times and in the number of seniors placed on the wait list, although both wait times and waiting list are shorter than 2014/15 when data were first reported.   Small incremental increases in the number of funded long-term care beds, with an increase of 464 beds (2%) over the past five years.   Assisted living continues to see flat to negative growth and the waiting list now represents 20% of total available units.  Better at Home saw an increase in the number of services offered; however, there is a continued trend of fewer new clients each year; this is reflective of existing clients staying on service and fixed funding that creates waiting lists.  Alzheimer Society First Link dementia support served 11,567 unique clients in 105 communities, with 5,000 new clients.  Property tax deferral continues to grow with a total of 63,581 seniors deferring over $237 million.   The Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) subsidy continues to grow beyond the rate of population growth; showing an increase in the proportion of seniors that rent and who require financial support. A total of 24,233 seniors were SAFER recipients with an average subsidy of $215 per month.  This is the fifth straight year there is a decline in the number of seniors subsidized housing units and an increase in the number of seniors on the waiting list. This year the waitlist increased by 14%.  The number of HandydDART clients in the BC transit system are down for the second year in a row, although up in the TransLink system.  29% (264,000) B.C. seniors are in receipt of the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS). The 3.9% increase in recipients is proportionate to the increase in the population.    The elimination of MSP premiums and recent changes to the Pharmacare deductibles and co-payments will have a positive financial impact on low- and moderate-income seniors. The degree of impact will vary depending on individual circumstances.   This is the fifth year of increases in the reporting of Abuse and Neglect to the Seniors Abuse and Information Line (SAIL), with a 7% increase in the last year.    The number of seniors reported missing to the RCMP increased in proportion to the seniors population growth between 2014 and 2018.

The QFD provides information on all publicly funded long-term care homes in British Columbia.  ﬁThe latest data demonstrate a significant increase in care hours over the past year, and we are clearly making considerable advancement on the goal of 3.36 hours of care per bed per day. This past year 216 facilities received an increase in their funded care hours and the percentage of care homes that are funded to the 3.36 recommended standard has doubled in the last year. The focus for the increase over the past year has been with contracted providers as they had lower funded direct care hours overall,ﬂ stated Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie.  In addition to funded hours of care the QFD reports on a series of quality indicators and other information of importance for care homes. New this year to the QFD are inspection reports and it showed a total of 765 inspections which found 1,103 infractions. Of the infractions found, 21% related to care and supervision, 19% to record keeping, and 13% to staffing.  One new facility, Cariboo Place was added to the QFD, however it opened in April 2019 and will not be reporting any operational data until next year.  The age demographic did not change with an average age of 85 and 5% of residents under the age of 65.  ﬁOverall, we found the population did not change in the last year. The Case Mix Index (CMI) which is a proxy to measure complexity remained at 0.58 and the residents with moderate to severe dementia remained at 29% with the overall rate of dementia at 64%. We did see a small increase (from 30% to 31%) of residents with total dependency in activities of daily livingﬂ stated Mackenzie. Highlights of the 2018/19 QFD include:  An overall increase of 3.8% in funded direct care hours, with 73% of facilities receiving more funding and double the number meeting the 3.36 guideline.   The average amount spent on food increased by 3.2% and ranged from $5.21 per bed to $19.88 per resident per day.   The average length of stay has remained relatively stable, however, there is great variation between health authorities with a low of 707 days in the Interior and a high of 1,084 days in Northern Health.  Overall care home per diems increased by 4.6% and range from $182.23 to $272.35 per bed per day.  There was almost no change overall in the percentage of residents receiving physical/ occupational/recreational therapy.  Use of daily restraints, remained the same at 7%, although it has dropped over the last five years from a high of 11%.   There was almost no drop in the inappropriate use of antipsychotic drugs, a trend that has continued for the past three years.   The rate of reportable incidents remained relatively unchanged in the past year and has dropped from 17.5 to 15.8 over the past five years. Substantiated complaints dropped over the past year from 7.4 per 1000 beds to 5.9.  The percentage of residents with low social engagement remains unchanged from last year (48%). ﬁOverall, we have seen very positive progress in relation to care hours and a positive shift in substantiated complaints.  Progress on the appropriate use of antipsychotics has stalled in the past three years and BC remains above the national average.  ‚With the 2019 update we now have five years of data which can allow us to look at developing trends and areas where we still need to make improvement such as the use of therapies,ﬂ concluded Mackenzie.

Over the ensuing 29 years, the population aged 65 and older has been growing worldwide. While there are many challenges faced by all of us as we age, let us take a moment today to realize how fortunate we are to age in a country like Canada. Yes, we absolutely have issues related to income insufficiency, access to care services, appropriate and affordable housing and accessible transportation but no one in Canada, whatever their age, needs to create a GoFundMe campaign to pay for basic medical care as they do in some other countries.   Let us also be thankful we live in a province that recognizes the value of older adults through initiatives such as ending mandatory retirement and creating the first statutory office of a Seniors Advocate.   As we look to the future and the work that lies ahead to ensure all B.C. seniors can age with dignity, living where they want and with whom they want, we should take great comfort in the huge commitment that seniors make to better their communities. There are literally hundreds of thousands of seniors throughout this province volunteering to: deliver meals; provide rides to medical appointments; raise money for hospital foundations; lead chair yoga sessions and visit those who cannot get to the seniors centre. Without this selfless donation of time, government would be spending close to a billion more dollars each year on services.  And just in case you think it is only about seniors helping other seniors, take a careful look at the faces (and hair colour) of those who have galvanized their efforts to raise awareness about the environment and other global issues. You will find that B.C. seniors care very much about future generations and the greater world around them.  Yes, today let us celebrate the incredible resource we have in this province with almost a million citizens endowed with the wisdom, experience, perspective and generosity that can only come with age.

Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie.  In a comprehensive report released today titled , Mackenzie examines the health care program, which is a lifeline for many seniors, and makes recommendations for improvement.  for as long as possible but the system which should enable that is falling shortys Mackenzie. When more than 60 per cent of seniors are entering long-term care having received no home support in the months leading up to their placement and 62 per cent of their family members are in distress, it is time to ask how effective the program is at assisting B.C. seniors to live at home   Home support, which can include dressing, bathing, meal preparation and other tasks, is intended to allow seniors to live independently longer, delaying or preventing admission to a long-term care facility. The program also supports timely discharge from hospital.   Key findings from the review include:   Public home support is unaffordable for most seniors. A senior with an income of $27,800 is expected to pay $8,800 a year for a once-daily home support visit;  61 per cent of residents admitted to long-term care received no home support in the 90 days before admission;   15 per cent (4200 beds) of long-term-care residents could be living in the community;   On average, a long-term care bed costs taxpayers $27,740 more per year than two hours of daily home support;  Overall 63 per cent of home support clients receive less than an hour of home support per day on average;  51 per cent of home support clients are assessed as high or very high risk for placement in long-term care but receive only 1.2 hours or less of home support per day on average;  Nearly one-third of family caregivers are in distress;  The community health workers who provide home support have the highest rate of casual/part time workers of any health care classification;  Home support has not kept pace with the growing number of seniors. Over the last five years, the number of seniors has grown by 22 per cent but the number of home support clients has increased by 15 per cent;  The rate of home support clients for the population 85 and older has decreased 4.3 per cent in the last five years; The rate of home support hours for the population 85 and older has decreased 10.3 per cent in the last five years; and  Complaints to the Patient Care Quality Office have increased 62 per cent in the last five years.  These numbers are reinforced by the feedback my office received through phone calls, letters, emails and personal contacts, and together they point to need for change.  The government has made progress on many fronts in the support of seniors: they are increasing the care hours in long-term care; adding adult daycare spaces; and creating more facility-based respite. I applaud them on these efforts and thank them on behalf of the seniors who will benefit from the additional investments. However, home support is also in desperate need and we must find the prematurely into long-term care because it is the only affordable option available to them and that overwhelmcare home because they could not get just a couple of hours of home support a day,Mackenzie.  The report makes a series of recommendations focused on making the program more affordable for seniors, increasing service levels, exploring a client direct-funding model, providing seniors with consistent and comprehensive information on the services available to them and exploring ways to make the job of being a community health worker more attractive.

The annual report examines a range of services and supports and measures whether they are keeping pace with the increased demand of a growing  population.   number of key factors; appropriate housing, sufficient income, adequate transportation, accessible health care and assistance with personal needs all must be available if seniors   stated Seniors Advocate Isobel MackenzieEach year my office looks at how we performed in all of these key areas and produces a robust report that contains dozens of pages of data. I encourage people to read through and see what is provided to support senio continued Mackenzie.   Some highlights of the 2018 report include:   The number of seniors using property tax deferral in 2017/18 has risen 53% since 2013/14, with a 21% increase in the last year alone. In 2017/18, there were a total of 57,305 seniors deferring their property taxes, of which 13,179 were new users of the program.  Total deferrals in 2017/18 are $208,868,338.   The rent subsidies through the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) program continue to grow beyond the rate of the target population.  There was a 7% increase in the number of SAFER recipients with 22,956 seniors receiving the supplement and a 34% increase in the aggregate amount paid for a total of $71 million in SAFER subsidies paid.   The number of seniors receiving home support service decreased by 1.4% despite a 4% increase in the population over age 65 and a 5% increase in the population over 85.  For those who did receive service, more hours were delivered as the total number of hours delivered remained about the same (less than 1% increase) resulting in a 2% increase in the average hours of care. Adult Day Program (ADP) access continued to decline.  There has been a 6% reduction in the number of ADP clients over the past two years with 2.8% in the last year alone, leaving a total of 5,895 ADP clients. This is coupled with an 17% reduction in the number of ADP days in the last two years (3.8 % reduction in the last year) telling us that the clients remaining are also receiving fewer days than in previous years (total of 217,990 ADP days).  Not surprisingly there is a 23% increase in the wait list for ADP.  There is a 2% decrease in publically subsidized registered assisted living units, but a 7% increase in privately funded registered assisted living units.  Long Term Care facilities saw a 2% reduction in turnover with an 8% reduction in new admissions.  Despite this, three health authorities experienced a reduction in the median length of stay.   With 1,379 people awaiting placement, waitlists as of March 2018 were 7% longer than March 2017 but 23% shorter than September 2016.  The percentage of seniors admitted to a care facility within 30 days rose to 71%, a 16% increase from the previous year. However, the rate varies between health authorities, from a low of 45% ( Island Health) to a high of 90% (Vancouver Coastal).  The increase in property offences against seniors continues to rise.  While only a 1% increase this year, for a total of 16,244 offences, there is a consistent and persistent trend that shows a 30% overall increase in property offences against seniors in the last four years.  The Seniors Abuse and Information Line (SAIL) saw a 12% increase in the number of calls received but a slight decrease (2%) in the number of calls related to elder abuse.   The Public Guardian and Trustee saw fewer Committee of Estate orders with a 5% decline this past year.   First Link saw a 10% increase this past year. A program to support those with dementia and their family members First Link is delivered by the Alzheimer Society of BC and supports 15,922 active clients.  Better at Home, a program delivered by the United Way of the Lower Mainland that addresses a number of the personal supports for seniors saw a 15% decrease in new clients. Seniors Advocate, Isobel Mackenzie comments on some of the highlights:  here are a significant number of supports for seniors, and while some services increased in tandem with the growing  population, others are not keeping up with demand.   The cost of housing is affecting seniors as the number deferring their property taxes has grown exponentially.  In addition, SAFER data show that seniors who rent are having a more difficult time as more are claiming the SAFER grant and they are receiving a higher subsidy-, telling us the gap between income and rent is growing.   The reduction in home support clients is puzzling as we should be seeing these numbers increase.  Recent announcements by the government on funding increases to home and community care are not reflected in these numbers as the effect of the increase has not yet materialized so hopefully we see this trend reversing next year.    The ADP numbers are very concerning.  However the recent announcement by the provincial government for $75 million targeted to ADP and respite will hopefully have an impact. While these numbers do not reflect the increased funding they do speak to how desperately the funding increase was needed.  ADP is often the lifeline for caregivers who are struggling to care for their loved one at home, and we need to make it more, not less accessible.   It is encouraging to see an increase in the number of seniors placed in long-term care within 30 days of assessment although some families are waiting much longer and there is significant variation between health authorities. However many seniors especially those living in Vancouver Coastal are managing to find a bed within a reasonable time.    It is certainly encouraging to see the number of families who access First Link increasing as well as seeing the continual decreases in the PGT Committee of Estate files; however the increase in property offences is of concern as seniors are particularly vulnerable. The decrease in Better at Home clients is a potential concern and we will continue to monitor.  My office will continue to work with all the various ministries, governments and service providers to ensure that we continue to try and improve the health and well-being of all   For more information contact:  Shelley Browne, Director of Communications 250-812-1679"

Care Reporting System (NACRS) from 24 hospitals in BC linked to 212 residential care facilities and their interRAI MDS 2.0 data for emergency department transfers, and the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) for all hospitals and facilities.  The data demonstrate that, compared to care homes operated directly by the health authority, residents who live in a care home that is operated by a contracted provider are:   32% more likely to be sent to the emergency department  34% more likely to be hospitalized   their length of stay in hospital is 32% longer  their chance of not returning to the care home converting to an alternative level of care (ALC) patient is 47% higher  54% more likely to die in the hospital  The Seniors Advocate advances the case that the numbers in the report require attention and raise a number of quesAt every turn whether it is the decision to call the ambulance, the decision to admit the resident as in-patient, the decision on when or if to discharge the resident back to the care facility we see the contracted care facilities persistently failing relative to the health authority operated facilities continued Mackenzie.   The report highlights a financial impact of $16 million saved annually, if contracted facilities were able to match the performance of the public facilities and it would also create an additional 15,481 bed days for an already congested system.  However, perhaps most importantly to the Seniors Advocate it would reduce the risk of hospital acquired infections or delirium, which combine to affect an estimated 50% of frail elderly patients.  deconditioning and the anxiety of unfamiliar places and interrupted routines can have a significant impact on the health and well- being of the frail elderly population.  We also know that most people want to die more than double the public facilities we really need to ask why contracted care facilities are seeing their residents die in the hospital,said Mackenzie, who commenced the study in response to findings from working shifts in six hospitals throughout B.C. The report highlights that contracted facilities care for less frail and complex residents than public facilities yet they send more residents to the hospital.  The report adjusted for resident complexity as well as funded hours of care and the same pattern held, higher hospitalization for residents of private care homes and much higher rates of death in the hospital.   less funded care staff, however neither of those variables explained the results.  This means we need to look at other issues related to the experience and continuity of the staff and the financial incentives for contracted care home operators,  Private care facilities, on average pay lower wages than public facilities.  Only 54 out of 184 private care facilities pay the top wages and benefits of the master collective agreement.  The report highlights that lower wages could result in less experienced staff and/or more staff turnover as care aides will leave for a position in a facility paying higher wages. These factors could contribute to staff who are less confident in their practice and more likely to send a resident to the hospital.  Constantly changing staff could also be problematic as continuity of care in nursing homes is proven to link with better health outcomes including lower rates of hospitalization.    The report poses a number of questions related to the lack of consistent data and information from contracted facilities.  In public facilities where the wages and benefits are both consistent and better there is a low staff turnover as supported by data from the Health Employers of BC, we cannot currently compare this with private facilities.    the level of clinical support offered to care staff in private facilities, the mix of RN and LPN, the use of Allied Health professionals, the practice for sick and vacation relief, the use of casual versus regular staff, the age and experience of the care staff are all variables that may be affecting the performance of the private residential care facilities and despite the fact they are funded by the Health Authorities, we are not consistently and systematically collected this information,enzie.   The report also questions whether the contractual nature of the relationship between health authorities and the care home are appropriate.  The report highlights that most contracted operators receive the same amount of money whether the resident is in the facility or the hospital and that facilities are funded to pay higher wages than they are actually paying.   The report calls upon the Ministry of Health to work with the Health Authorities to get more information and data to answer the many questions raised in the report.   -30-    For More Information Contact:  Linda Carey 778-698-8143"

Vancouver- Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie today released Seniors Transportation: Affordable, Appropriate and Available. The report, which reflects over a year of consultation and research, concludes that changes are required to address some of the existing transportation systems and a new program will be required to fill some of the gaps.   licence but this drops to hen we begin retirement with driving ourselves to activities and appointments but find, many years later, that we are still living independently and engaged with our community but we are not able to get ourselves out and about by car any longer.  Most of the public transportation currently offered traditional transit, HandyDART, Taxi Saver Vouchers, all offer support to some seniors some of the time, but none can fill all transportation needs for all seniors. While family and friends can fill many of the gaps they are a shrinking pool and not all seniors have family and friends who can get them out and about,Mackenzie.  The report highlights that getting a person from point A to B does not totally capture the transportation needs of frail and vulnerable seniors. Many seniors may have the physical ability to take a bus or use HandyDART, but they have cognitive challenges that require someone to accompany them, or their physical frailty requires someone to assist them throughout their trip. None of the current programs provide for these needs and even with recommended improvements, the report notes they will continue to fall short.   To fill the gap, Mackenzie has recommended a new program called would be administered under the existing home support program.   The provincial home support program assesses the physical and cognitive function of seniors, determines what their needs are, determines how much they can contribute to the cost of needed services and hires, schedules and supervises thousands of staff who deploy every day to assist seniors in maintaining their independence. Along with helping seniors get bathed, dressed and ensuring they take their medications, the program could easily schedule someone to pick up the senior and take them to a medical appointment. Using the existing infrastructure of home support will allow the program to get up and running quickly and will reduce duplication. The report notes that a roundHandyDART costs the province about $80, while an hour of home support can cost less than $38.  In addition to the new service, Mackenzie has called for improvements on a number of fronts.   public bus system for the first time in 60 years,, who recommended a with someone who could help them figure out how the bus system works and even ride with them for the first few times.   HandyDART is a lifeline, especially for those who are wheelchair-bound, yet it is only offered in 25 out of 31 transit systems and only about one-quarter of the systems offer night and weekend service. Mackenzie has recommended that HandyDART be expanded to more transit systems and there be an increase in the number of night time and weekend routes.   The report recognizes the significant contribution that family members and friends make in providing transportation, and Mackenzie has recommended that costs related to fuel and parking be allowed as a tax deduction for those who drive those frail seniors who are no longer able to drive themselves. tax payer is for family and friends to drive their loved ones; with rising costs, we should consider some relief through tax deductions just   The report also touches on the contentious issue of the cost charged by physicians for the Driver Medical Examination Report (DMER). Mackenzie has recommended that all class 5 licence renewals that require a DMER be treated the same. This would result in physician reimbursement of $75 for those who are required to complete the DMER because they are age 80 or older. really an irritant rather than an impediment, but it is an issue I hear about surprisingly often and seniors do appear to have a point about age-based discrimination in terms of DMER costs that are subsidized by RoadSafetyBC,  The report also comments on improvements for pedestrians recognizing that walking is a form of transportation used by many seniors and also examines the shortcomings of the taxi industry.    A complete list of the 15 recommendations made are attached and the full report is availale at: http://www.seniorsadvocatebc.ca/  seniors is a complex problem, and solving it will require many different solutions. But if everyone works together   For more information contact Office of the Seniors Advocate Edward Gomboc - 778-679-3492(cell) Recommendations  1.  The Province coordinate with ICBC to get information about transportation alternatives and other community supports into the hands of those seniors who are not renewing their drivers licence. 2.  The Province reimburse physicians a standardized rate for the completion of the DMER regardless of whether it is a blue or yellow form for those seeking to renew a class 5 licence.  3.    The Province examine the possibility of expanding the range of health care professionals that can conduct  the DMER.  4.  The Province work with local governments to explore ways of achieving more pedestrian-friendly communities through the use of grants, tax incentives, rebates and other tools that local government may have or be given. Pedestrian-friendly developments in terms of location to shops and services should be incentivized, and infrastructure that supports mobility-challenged pedestrians moving about in the commercial hubs where shops and services are located should be required. 5.  Support people who volunteer to drive their family members, friends or neighbours to medical appointments. Just as tax deductions are allowed for those who use their personal vehicles for business, examine the possibility of a similar tax relief program for someone who acts as the primary driver for a senior who is no longer in possession of a current drivers licence and qualifies for HandyDART and/or the Federal Disability Tax Credit. 6.  All British Columbians regardless of where they live should have access to Taxi Saver vouchers if they qualify.  7.  All taxi companies must require their drivers to accept Taxi Saver vouchers.  8.  The Province work with BC Transit and TransLink to establish a standardized, province-wide Seniors Bus Buddiesprogram that will connect seniors with local volunteers or staff that will work with the senior to initiate them into the use of public transit. This may require riding the bus with the senior for the first few times and ensuring they have numbers available to call if there are problems. Linking with ICBC and with the local Health Units will help ensure those who will benefit the most are connected to the service. 9.  The Province work with BC Transit and TransLink to increase the number of benches at bus stops.  10.  Create an annual seniors bus pass where the fee charged will be based on income. The pass should be considered eligible payment on HandyDART if the passenger has a HandyCard or handyPASS. 11.  Develop a province-wide mandated training program for transit drivers focused on supporting senior transit users.  12.  Continued efforts need to be made for increasing the availability of HandyDART services. Priority should be given to the 6 transit systems with no HandyDART followed by those communities with no evening and weekend services.  13.  The fees charged to clients who use HandyDART should be reviewed, and a more progressive approach that recognizes income and frequency of use be applied to ensure that cost is not a barrier for low-income seniors who need to use HandyDART. In particular, the consideration should be given to allow the BC Bus Pass to be considered eligible payment. 14.  HandyDART users should be able to access HandyDART anywhere in the province, regardless of the local transit authority they are registered with. 15.  The government work with the Health Authorities and the affected unions to establish a community drives program that will be administered through the home support program in all areas of British Columbia. The principles of access and equity that are enshrined in the home and community care program should be applied."

Seniors Advocate is reinforcing the need for seniors in the province to file tax returns, even if they think they do not make enough income to file.   ﬁSeniors may not know that there are several subsidies and tax credits they may be eligible for that are dependent on completed tax returns,ﬂ said Isobel Mackenzie. ﬁThis is particularly important for low-income seniors who may be missing out on subsidies and tax credits that could help them financially,ﬂ Mackenzie added.  ﬁThe good news is, most government programs that are income based are linked to the Canada Revenue Agency who will automatically advise the province of an individual senior™s latest income upon which to base a subsidy, so seniors are not required to re-apply every year,ﬂ Mackenzie said. ﬁThe bad news is, if seniors don™t file income tax, their subsidy for things like PharmaCare and SAFER could be dropped and seniors could be left paying the full cost of their drugs or losing their rent subsidy. In addition fees for residential care and home support are based on income and without verification from the latest tax return, seniors will find themselves paying the full rate.ﬂ   There are approximately 250 free Volunteer Income Tax Clinics operating throughout the province that are able to assist seniors who may require help to file their taxes.

Seniors Advocate released third annual comprehensive directory for residential care facilities (pdf, 126 KB)","NEWS RELEASE  For Immediate Release January 31, 2018  B.C. Seniors Advocate posts comprehensive Directory of B.C.™s  publicly-subsidized residential care facilities   Victoria Œ The Office of the Seniors Advocate posted an updated version of the British Columbia Residential Care Facilities Quick Facts Directory today.  The Directory, first published in 2016, provides key information in a standardized format for 293 publicly funded licensed care facilities in British Columbia, representing 27,142 publicly subsidized beds.  A summary document highlights key trends in residential care based on the past three years of data.   ﬁThe Directory is designed to be a useful resource for seniors, their caregivers and the public when making decisions about what care home may best suit an individual™s needs,ﬂ said Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie.  ﬁWe have also discovered information in the Directory can provide us with a useful tool to look at systemic issues,ﬂ Mackenzie added.  The Directory provides information relating to a number of areas, including bed/room configuration, food services, inspection information, care services, as well as information about the health characteristics of residents in B.C.™s facilities.  The Directory also provides quality of care indicators as reported by the Canadian Institute of Health Information.  These include data about residents™ access to therapies, level of social engagement, use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications, and use of physical restraints.  This year™s Directory also includes facility-level results from the Office of the Seniors Advocate™s recent survey of people living in residential care and their family members.  ﬁThere is arguably no better measure of gauging the quality of care of a facility than talking to the people who live there,ﬂ said Mackenzie.  ﬁThis year™s Directory provides an opportunity to hear the voices of those who experience, on a daily basis, what it™s like to live in licensed care homes, and that™s very important information to share,ﬂ Mackenzie said, adding that survey questions focused on a range of areas from observations about food and staff responsiveness to social engagement and physician care.   The Advocate also released a summary document highlighting trends based on the data contained in the Directory.  Highlights include:   Only 15% of facilities meet the provincial guideline of 3.36 hours of direct care per resident per day in 2016/17.  This is an improvement over the previous year, when only 9% were meeting the guideline.  Four percent of contracted facilitiesŠcompared to 33% of health authority owned and operated facilitiesŠ were funded to meet or exceed the guideline. Overall, 73% of residents reside in single-occupancy rooms; 87% of rooms in residential care are single-occupancy, 9% are double-occupancy and 4% are multi-bed rooms.  There are some differences between facilities based on ownership type.  Health authority owned and operated facilities, on average, have higher funded direct care hours, higher rates of therapy, fewer single-occupancy rooms, more complex and physically-dependent residents, and fewer reportable incidents and substantiated complaints compared to contracted facilities.  On average, almost half of all residents had a low sense of social engagement, (0-2 on the seven point Index of Social Engagement measurement tool).  In 2016/17, there were 4,629 reportable incidents reported to Licensing Officers in B.C. This is slightly higher than in 2015/16 (4,579).  However, the rate of reportable incidents decreased from 17.5 incidents per 100 beds in 2015/16 to 17.4 incidents per 100 beds in 2016/17. Overall, the rate of reportable incidents was 24% higher in contracted facilities than in health authority owned and operated facilities.  Between 2015/16 and 2016/17, substantiated complaints fell by 13%, from 207 to 181.  In 2016/17, there were 1.6 substantiated complaints per 1,000 beds involving health authority owned and operated facilities, and 8.9 per 1,000 beds in contracted facilities. The ﬁconversion rateﬂ of complaints to substantiated complaints was 54% higher in contracted compared to health authority owned and operated facilities.  Across B.C., 24% of residents were diagnosed with depression and 48% of residents were prescribed antidepressant medication, both of which are very similar to previous years.  In 2016/17, 25% of residents were prescribed antipsychotic medications without a diagnosis of psychosis, which is a 7% decrease from the previous year.  Between October 2016 and September 2017, 8% of residents had daily physical restraintsŠan 11% decrease from the previous year.  Data on the average funded food costs per resident, per day were collected for the first time in 2016/17.  The average funded food cost in B.C. in 2016/17 was $8.00 per resident, per day.  However, there was significant variation among facilities ranging from an overall low of $4.92 to a high of $18.44 per resident per day.  Overall, 24% of facilities contract out food services, and 91% of facilities have food prepared on site.

The report looks at over 25 programs and services offered to seniors in B.C. and measures performance on a year over year basis.   ﬁThis is now the third year my office has published this report and we are seeing some very meaningful trends that can tell us whether we are heading in the right direction in delivering the supports and services that are key to assisting seniors to maintain independence and enjoy good health,ﬂ said B.C. Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie.   The report shows growth in the seniors™ population is on track with projections as the number of people in the province over the age of 65 grew by 32,307 to a total of 18.4% of the population compared to 17.9% last year.  With a B.C. total of 882,731 people age 65 and over, Vancouver Island Health Authority and Interior Health Authority continue to have the highest rate of seniors at 23% of their population while Northern Health continues to have the youngest population with only 14% of their population age 65 and older.   ﬁThe results for 2017 highlight several areas of concern for me,ﬂ said Mackenzie. ﬁThere is a continued decrease in home support service and adult day programs as well as an increasing lack of affordability for senior renters,ﬂ Mackenzie added.  ﬁThese results should also be of concern to the government as lack of support in these areas will drive some seniors into residential care which is a more costly intervention and one that is least preferred by seniors. We know there are up to 15% of seniors living in residential care who could live in the community with proper supports.ﬂ  With 19% of senior households renting, the affordability gap continues to widen with rents for a one-bedroom apartment increasing 6.7% with no increase to the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) subsidy cap and basic retirement income rising by only 1.2%.  In addition, the number of seniors™ subsidized housing units continued to decrease and the waiting list increased 15.6%.  ﬁThe economic reality for seniors who rent is the most dire,ﬂ said Mackenzie. ﬁWe know that seniors have the lowest median income of any age cohort over 25 and we know that the poverty rate for seniors increased by 24% since 2005, the largest increase of any age cohort.  The ability of seniors, particularly those aged 80 and greater to move to less expensive neighbourhoods is very limited.  Seniors must be located near transit and services given they will depend on these more and more as they age.ﬂ   The report also looks at trends in transportation services for seniors highlighting that for the first time in four years there has been an increase in HandyDART ride requests. There was a 5% increase in new clients and a 10% increase in the number of rides. ﬁTransportation is very important and can be quite complicated for seniors, as they may have some mobility or vision challenges that no longer allow them to drive but they are still active and engaged in their community,ﬂ said Mackenzie. ﬁHandyDART can mean the difference between being a total shut-in and able to get out 2 or 3 times a week.ﬂ  For the 81% of senior households that own their home, the number of new individuals claiming property tax deferment nearly doubled in the last year.  ﬁThe popularity of the Property Tax Deferment Program demonstrates its value in helping those seniors who are homeowners to address the rising costs of  NEWS RELEASE maintaining a home,ﬂ Mackenzie said.  As in past years, seniors show a high level of attachment to a family doctor and 2017 saw decreasing wait times for residential care after they increased last year. 2017 is the first year the Monitoring Seniors™ Services report has included data from police sources regarding reported crimes of abuse and theft against seniors.  Both the Public Guardian and Trustee and the Seniors Abuse and Information Line (SAIL) reported increases in the number of abuse and neglect cases reported.   ﬁPart of what this report highlights is the significant number of services that are available to assist seniors, ensuring they keep pace with demand and that they are easily accessible is equally important.  Reviewing our performance on an annual basis is an important measure of our success,ﬂ concluded Mackenzie.  See below for highlights of the 2017 Monitoring Seniors™ Services report.

Ł     While the number of B.C. seniors with dementia has increased since last year, the rate of dementia has remained constant; 94% of seniors 65+ and 80% of seniors 85+ do not have dementia. The number of clients supported by the First Link program has increased 15%. Ł     The average home support hours delivered per client per year decreased by 3% from the previous year, while the number of clients increased by 3.5%. This trend of decreases in home support matched against increased client complexity continues to be of concern. Ł     There has been a 23.5% increase in the number of home care complaints over last year; this includes professional services such as nursing and physical therapy, as well as home support. Ł     On March 31, 2017, there were 1,245 clients waiting to access Adult Day Programs. The median wait time ranged between 38 and 195 days. Since 2015/16, there has been an 8% decrease in the number of funded Adult Day Program days offered and a 4% decrease in clients. Ł     While there has been a 1.5% increase in funded residential care beds since last year, the population aged 75+ increased by 3.5%.

Ł     The number of Seniors™ Subsidized Housing units continues to decrease. From 2013/14 to 2016/17, there was a decrease of almost 5%. The number of people 55 or older waiting for a unit increased nearly 16% in the last year alone. Ł     The median and average wait times for Seniors Subsidized Housing increased slightly from 1.3 to 1.4 years and 2.2 to 2.3 years, respectively, between 2015/16 and 2016/17.

Transportation Ł     There was a 5% increase in the number of new clients registered for HandyDART from last year, a 10% increase in ride requests, and a 10% increase in rides provided. Ł     There was an 8% increase in unaccommodated standby ride requests for HandyDART in Metro Vancouver. Ł     In 2016, 655,000, or 76%, of all seniors maintained an active driver™s licence, a 4.5% increase since 2015. The population 65+ grew 4% over this same time period.  Ł     In 2016, 65,810 driver fitness cases were opened for those aged 80 or older. Only 950 seniors (fewer than 2%), were subsequently referred for a DriveAble cognitive assessment.  Income Supports Ł     The maximum payment for CPP increased by 2% over last year. Ł     The Seniors Supplement, a monthly top-up provided by the provincial government to  low income seniors remains at $49.30. There has been no rate increase since 1987. Ł     As of January 1, 2018, single seniors with an income of up to $45,000 or senior couples with an income of up to $51,000 may be eligible for some level of MSP Premium Assistance based on allowable deductions.

Seniors Advocate releases results of landmark residential care survey  Vancouver Œ B.C. Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie released provincial results of her office™s survey of publicly subsidized residential care homes today. This is the most extensive survey of residents™ quality of life ever conducted in Canada.  ﬁFor the first time in this province, we have heard the collective voices of some of our most frail and vulnerable seniors across all of our care homes,ﬂ said Mackenzie. ﬁWhat they are telling us is that while some are satisfied in some areas, overall, we need to be doing better, and in some cases, much better in ensuring the needs of residents are met,ﬂ Mackenzie added.  The survey asked a range of questions on residents™ experiences of day to day activities and care from questions about food quality and staff responsiveness to observations of physician care and social connectedness. The survey was conducted between June 2016 and May 2017. Residents™ most frequent visitors, usually a family member, were also mailed surveys.  ﬁWe are very good at using clinical measurements to gauge how we™re doing in this area such as numbers of falls etc.,ﬂ said Mackenzie. ﬁWhat we haven™t been good at is actually asking the residents themselves what they think of the care they receive and this survey gave us the opportunity to hear feedback that is so critical in making care improvements,ﬂ Mackenzie added.   Key positive responses from the survey include:   50% of residents rated the overall quality of the care home as very good or excellent with 83% of residents believing the staff know what they are doing  88% of family members report being involved in decisions about the care of their loved one  80% of residents indicate they get the services they need  65% of family members rated the facility 8 or higher when 10 was the highest possible score  88% feel safe in the care home  86% of residents feel staff treat them with respect   88% of family members or most frequent visitors report that facility staff addresses their concerns always or most of the time  Key areas where residents and families said improvements are needed include:   62% of residents say they do not get to bathe or shower as often as they want   One in four residents say they sometimes, rarely or never get help to the toilet when needed and 25% of residents report staff tries to relieve physical discomfort sometimes, rarely or never    More than one-third of residents report they are not consistently getting the help they need at mealtimes  Almost 46% of residents report there is no one living in the facility that they consider a close friend and 45% report there is no one for them to do things with   Less than half (46%) of residents say staff regularly make time for friendly conversation 49% of residents only sometimes, rarely or never have the same care aide on most weekdays  4 out of 10 residents living in residential care do not want to be there  Only 57% of residents report that the care facility regularly feels like home  ﬁWe have heard from 20,000 British Columbians - 10,000 residents and 10,000 family members - and together their voices send three strong messages–more staff, more freedom and more conversation,ﬂ said Mackenzie. ﬁResidents need more help in some areas reflecting the fact there are not enough staff; many are lonely and want to be talked to and engaged and they want what we all do, more freedom to control all aspects of their day to day lives from when they get up in the morning to what time of day they eat their meals.ﬂ  The Advocate makes eight recommendations in the report for system improvements including increasing care hours and ensuring staffing levels are enforced and monitored by heath authorities, increasing flexibility of how and when care is delivered, increasing training focused on the emotional needs of residents, expanding the role of nurse practitioners in residential care facilities and increasing the range of activities provided in residential care facilities, particularly in the evenings and weekends. The Advocate also recommends ongoing use of this survey tool to ensure progress is monitored.  ﬁWe have to remember that for people who are living in residential care, this is their home, and very likely their last home,ﬂ said Mackenzie. ﬁWe need to do all that we can to ensure those who live there, have the very best experience possible.ﬂ  Background and full highlights of the Office of the Seniors Advocate™s Residential Care Survey are available at www.seniorsadvocatebc.ca   Media contact:  Sara Darling  Director of Communications  Office of the Seniors Advocate  778-679-2588"

Data highlighted in the current report indicate rates of distress have increased by 7% to 31%.  ﬁThis is a disturbing trend on its own when we think of the daily reality for all the sons, daughters, spouses, neighbours and friends who are dedicating hundreds of hours caring for loved ones,ﬂ said Mackenzie. ﬁHowever there is even more cause for concern when we look at additional data in this report that indicate the frailty and complexity of those we are caring for at home is actually increasing, and the supports and services that can make an immense difference to the lives of caregivers are not keeping pace.ﬂ  The report focuses on the caregivers of individuals receiving publicly subsidized home support in the province, as this is the only sub-set of the caregiving community where measurable data using detailed health care assessments are available.  This report also relies on data that tracks key support services such as Adult Day Programs, which provide regular programming and relief to caregivers, respite in residential care facilities, and additional home support services, that also help provide a reprieve from caregiving duties.   ﬁHaving a break for even a few hours can make a huge difference in the lives of caregivers who are feeling exhausted and overwhelmed,ﬂ said Mackenzie. ﬁFor some caregivers, time alone to refocus and recharge is something very precious and we need to recognize that it can make the difference between feeling strong enough to carry on with caring commitments, or giving up entirely.ﬂ  Key findings of the report include:   In 2015/16, 31% of clients had a primary caregiver in distress. This is a 7% increase from the 2015 report  Over this period, the actual number of primary caregivers identifying as distressed increased by over 1,000, which represents a 14% increase in the actual number of caregivers in distress  The number of home support clients accessing Adult Day Programs decreased by 5% and the number of days delivered to these clients decreased by 2%   The average hours of home support per day per client over 65 decreased by 5%, signaling less intensive service ﬁUnpaid caregivers are a vital, often unrecognized yet critical piece in ensuring the stability of our health care system,ﬂ said Mackenzie, adding there are approximately one million unpaid caregivers in the province whose paid value is estimated to be $3.5 billion. ﬁThe importance of maximizing supports can™t be underestimated when we consider costly alternatives such as residential care or hospital stays.ﬂ  The full report can be viewed at www.seniorsadvocatebc.ca   Media contact:  Sara Darling  Director of Communications  Office of the Seniors Advocate  778-679-2588"

The report is a yearly update from the OSA on the status of key seniors™ services in the province, highlighting where seniors™ needs are being met and where improvements are most needed.   ﬁThis report gives an opportunity to start seeing year over year how we are doing in delivering seniors™ services,ﬂ said Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie. ﬁIt™s encouraging to see where improvements are being met, but this report is also a valuable tool in highlighting where we could be doing better,ﬂ Mackenzie added.   Among areas that highlight positive progress, the report notes that there has been an increase in the number of new users of the provincial government™s Property Tax Deferment Program, a program that allows low-income seniors to live in their own homes. Data from the report also show that over 90% of seniors have GPs, and in terms of transportation services, the number of unfilled HandyDART ride requests decreased.    The report also outlines a number of areas of concern. There are more seniors waiting for Seniors™ Subsidized Housing, while the number of units stayed relatively flat. Wait times for residential care have also increased and the number of residential care complaints has increased. In addition, although the Advocate has been calling for increases to the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) maximum rent that qualifies for a subsidy, this amount remains unchanged while there has been a decrease in vacancy and a concurrent increase in average rents.  The 70-page Monitoring Seniors™ Services report focuses on 2015/16 data, highlighting key services in the Advocate™s legislated mandate, which include transportation, health care, housing, income support, and personal care. Data were collected from service providers, health authorities, and government agencies.   ﬁWhen we look at these data collectively, the story that starts to emerge is that there are obvious improvements that need to be made, particularly in the areas of home support, residential care, and independent housing for seniors; these are areas that we will continue to work on in 2017,ﬂ said Mackenzie. The OSA will be releasing systemic reviews of home support and residential care in 2017.

HandyDART is a door-to-door service provided by TransLink, BC Transit, and their service providers for passengers with physical or cognitive disabilities who are unable to use conventional public transit without assistance. The majority of users, approximately 73%, are 65 or older. Last year 2.37 million rides were provided, with 51% of these in the Lower Mainland.    ﬁTransportation is identified as a key issue for seniors,ﬂ said Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie noting that at age 65, 76% of seniors have an active driver™s license, and that drops to 34% for those over 85. ﬁClearly we need to ensure a robust transportation system is in place for seniors, most of who are still active, but may no longer be able to drive. HandyDART is part of that system and we need to ask the people who are using the service how well it is meeting their overall transportation needs,ﬂ said Mackenzie.    The survey asks a range of questions starting with what people think of the application process, the availability of rides, the cost of the service, as well as overall satisfaction levels. To ensure statistical integrity, a sample of every other client will be surveyed on Vancouver Island, the Okanagan, and the Lower Mainland, while for the other three regions that offer service, all clients will be surveyed.    The questions for the survey were developed through a consultation process that included users of HandyDART, service funders as well as front-line staff.  ﬁIn any of these surveys it is important that we are asking the right questions and involving those who both use and deliver the service ensures we don™t miss anything important,ﬂ said Mackenzie.  ﬁEnsuring a standardized approach to questions is also key to understanding the overall system and allows us to compare results from different parts of the province.ﬂ   Recipients of the survey can either complete a paper-based survey or fill it out online.

When it comes to seniors, think again (pdf, 94 KB)","Statement  For Immediate Release September 29th 2016    Think you™re not prejudiced? When it comes to seniors, think again.  October 1st is the United Nations-declared ﬁInternational Day of the Older Person.ﬂ The theme this year is ageism, a prejudice that the UN describes as the most socially-normalized form of discrimination worldwide. The term was coined in 1969 to describe a form of discrimination based on age. Since this time, we have seen a number of barriers broken: gay people can legally marry, women lead governments and the Supreme Court of Canada, people in wheelchairs hold public office and win gold medals, and the United States has elected an African-American as President. Yet, when it comes to age, our entrenched discrimination has remained relatively unchanged. If you think this prejudice doesn™t apply to you, at some point it has or it will. It may be subtle, such as expressing surprise that 80-year-old Aunt Dorothy is still driving and going to the gym, or commenting ﬁisn™t that sweetﬂ when describing someone going on a date at the age of 85. Think if we talked about the achievements of others in such patronizing waysŠ ﬁHe™s so successful for a black man.ﬂ ﬁWhat a remarkable achievement, considering she is a woman.ﬂ etc.  This past weekend, I met with my 30-member Council of Advisors, a highly diverse and engaged group of seniors who help guide the work of my office. We had a deep discussion about ageism. One of the more fascinating revelations was the acknowledgement that how seniors view themselves can also feed into ageism. The gathering of the Council was also another opportunity to be reminded that seniors don™t all think the same way. Vigorous debate erupted around the tables about financial abuse and the line between a person™s obligation for due diligence, which does not end at age 65, and the need to protect the truly vulnerable. Anyone who could have witnessed the discussion would have been reminded that age does not homogenize thinking or political views. The conversation also underscored the systemic ageism we practice in the care community when we presume to know what is ﬁbestﬂ for seniors, as opposed to listening to what they actually want.   It™s important to remember that all people of sound mind in our society are entitled to the right of self-determination. This is true for the 30-year-old climbing Mount Everest and should be equally true of the 92-year-old climbing stairs up to the bedroom they have slept in for 60 years. Both activities have risk associated with them, but we are inherently much better at accepting the 30-year-old™s decision and may be impressed by their bravery and stamina, as opposed to stunned by the 92-year-old™s cavalier recklessness. Many who are 92 are perfectly capable of understanding that they may fall and fracture a hip, but they accept that risk because what they have chosen to value more highly is to sleep in their own bedroom. Stereotyping seniors and their behaviours is deeply entrenched in society. Contrary to some public perception, seniors are not all rich and enjoying the golf course; in fact, half of BC seniors have an income of less than $24,000. We are not all headed for the nursing home; 85% of seniors over the age of 85 live independently. We are not all going to develop a dementia; 80% of seniors over the age of 85 do not have a diagnosis of dementia. The emergency departments are not flooded with seniors; in fact, only 22% of emergency department visits are from those over 65. I could go on, but you get the idea. Seniors are not a problem to be solved, a cost curve to be ﬁbent,ﬂ or victims simply by virtue of age. Wikipedia has one definition for ageism, but ironically quite a different one for the word ﬁsenior,ﬂ a term defined as ﬁa person of higher rank or standing than another, especially by virtue of longer service.ﬂ So just like the Vice President of a company would listen attentively to the wishes of the ﬁSeniorﬂ Vice President of the company, let us citizens listen a little more closely to the aspirations of the ﬁseniorﬂ citizens of our society.

Survey results show that, overall, clients are satisfied with the quality of the home support services they receive (62%). However, many respondents want more services to be available to them, such as housekeeping (28%) and meal preparation (12%). Additional highlights include an overwhelming recognition that home support staff are caring and respectful (92%), but there were also concerns around the number of different workers (20% of clients say they get too many regular workers), as well as the lack of skills and training of some home support workers (only 47% of clients think their workers have all necessary skills to provide good care).   ﬁWe need to look at how the housekeeping and meal preparation needs of our clients can be better met, how we can reduce the number of different workers involved in care delivery, and how we can increase the skills of a workforce that is highly compassionate,ﬂ said Mackenzie.  In addition to questions about home support services, the survey asked clients about their use and awareness of medications. The survey found 80% of clients knew how many medications they were taking, but there was a much lower rate of awareness around why a client is using them (only 59% know why they are taking all medications) and their side effects (only 17% know the side effects for all of their medications). ﬁClearly, all of us involved in the care of seniors, from physicians and pharmacists to nurses and family members, need to be more diligent about communicating possible side effects of medications. This is important at any age, but particularly crucial for seniors because, in some cases, we might think there is a cognitive impairment or permanent condition when, in fact, what we are seeing is a side effect from one of the many medications some seniors are prescribed,ﬂ said Mackenzie.   The Office of the Seniors Advocate™s home support survey was conducted in the fall of 2015. Responses were received from 5,336 clients and 4,040 family members.

My colleague Dr. Perry Kendall, Provincial Health Officer highlighted the vulnerability of senior pedestrians in his report, Where Rubber Meets the Road: Reducing the Impact of Motor Vehicle Crashes on Health and Well-being in BC.  This report points out that there were 2,200 motor vehicle accidents involving at least one pedestrian in BC in 2013.  These resulted in 2,300 injured pedestrians and 52 pedestrian fatalities.  strians aged 76 and up is more than twice the MVC fatality rate for pedestrians 66-75 and that overall, those over 76 had the highest rate of fatalities per 100,000 population.  Dr. Kendall found that there were a number of contributing factors that cause these accidents, including pedestrian error or confusion (31%), distraction on the part of the driver or pedestrian (29.3%), alcohol (19%), driver failing to yield the right of way (9.5%), and speed (8.8%).  The impact of these pedestrian accidents to the individual, their families and the system at large is obviously significant.  In the case of seniors, injury is much more likely to lead to a permanent decrease in overall function.  As the Office of the Seniors Advocate continues to monitor transportation issues relating to seniors, I would like to personally encourage you to consider pedestrian-focused enhancements in your communities that help ensure the safety of older citizens is a priority and these enhancements include: mechanisms to decrease crossing distances, increasing crossing times, improving pedestrian lighting, and modifying roadways, especially intersections, where most pedestrian accidents occur.  Appropriate speed limits must also be a priority, particularly in areas that have a high number of pedestrians.  Research shows that pedestrians have a 10% risk of dying when hit at 30 kilometres per hour, but an 80% risk of dying when hit at 50 kilometres per hour.  The continued education of both drivers and pedestrians is something I will continue to encourage.  Age-friendly initiatives should continue to focus on as much safe pedestrian access as possible, ultimately improving the overall health and well-being of our elderly population.  I look forward to your continued collaboration on this most important issue.

Their median income has increased 9.7% and far outpaces the national average.  However, for seniors in BC, the story is the complete opposite,ﬂ stated Mackenzie.  Since 2013, BC senior families saw their annual median income fall 5.7% and for a BC single senior, the decline is even steeper, with a 6.3% drop since 2013.  This compares to the national averages, which show a 1.9% increase for senior families and a 2.3% increase for single seniors.  BC™s single, working-age individuals, by comparison, saw a 4.7% increase and working-age couples in BC with children saw a 9.7% increase in their income.  This exceeds the national averages, which saw a decrease of 2.0% and an increase of 4.5%, respectively. Nationally, the percentage of Canadians aged 65 and over living on low incomes rose to 12.5%. In particular, 30% of single, elderly women are considered low incomeŠtriple the level of two decades ago.  ﬁWe have to start paying attention to what the data are telling us and stop listening to generationally divisive inaccurate generalizations that portray seniors as rich,ﬂ said Mackenzie.  ﬁMedian income gives us one of the best measures of incomes, as it is not distorted by the very high or very low incomes of small minorities.  We know that seniors have the lowest median income of any age cohort over 25 and now we know that, in BC, seniors™ incomes are actually shrinking while other age groups are experiencing significant increases,ﬂ Mackenzie added.   Mackenzie points out the reason for the decreases vary, but record low interest rates, life expectancy exceeding the time frame of a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF), and the inability of private pensions to provide cost of living increases all contribute.  In BC, the lowest income seniors (54,000) receive the BC Seniors Supplement, which has remained the same amount for over 25 years.  ﬁWe also need to remember that, while most seniors do not have a mortgage, over 20% are renters and 35% do not live in one of the over-heated real estate markets,ﬂ said Mackenzie.  ﬁThere are definitely seniors in the Lower Mainland and Greater Victoria with a great amount of equity in their homes, but we need to find a way that will responsibly allow seniors to access their equity, while also recognizing that some areas of the province are experiencing stagnant house values.ﬂ  Mackenzie stresses that financial assistance should be based on economic need, not age alone.  ﬁSeniors are as different as the population at large, and like most people, believe in a progressive approach to subsidies and entitlements.  The one distinction is that some policies that may be considered to have contrary incentives within the working population are in fact reasonable when looking at a population that is not, and will not be, an active participant in the labour force,ﬂ Mackenzie said.

The report examined 422 incidents of aggression leading to harm between residents in care homes in the province last year, most of which occurred in facilities with a high proportion of residents with complex care needs.  When we started this review, our intent was to see where patterns emerge when it comes to this , although many of these incidents follow no obvious pattern, there are still some particular commonalities that we feel are important to scrutinize further, Mackenzie added.   While conducting research for this report, the Office of the Seniors Advocate reviewed over 400 individual incident reports. The Office also compared data regarding overall characteristics of facilities, including medication use, incidence of dementia, and funded overall health status were also examined.   The first thing that emerged when we started to look at the data is the striking inconsistency of how information is collected and tracked on aggression, different incident reporting forms, and different protocols regarding follow-up, which makes   Key findings -resident to resident aggression occurred in the last year. Overwhelmingly, residents in these facilities have higher care needs, including more diagnosed aggression behaviors, psychiatric diagnoses, and higher rates of antipsychotic drug use. The report finds that there were slightly less funded direct care hours in high-incident facilities versus other facilities.  tranaid Mackenzie. Even in facilities with the most complex residents and highest incidence of aggression some fall below the minimum provincial guideline of an average of 3.36 care hours per resident per day and we must look more closely at what appropriate care hours are in these facilities. I know the Minister of Health shares my concern and he has called for a systemic provincial review of care hours.   Additional findings include:   One third of incidents occurred remainder occurred in shared areas, such as the dining room  Incident-reporting facilities tend to be larger and have a higher proportion of singe occupant rooms, and a lower proportion of multi-bed rooms.  Most incidents occurred between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. 41% of aggressors and 53% of victims were 85 or older; 59% of residents in long term care are 85 or older  Males were the aggressor in 61% of incidents, while females were the victim in 69% of incidents. Both the aggressor and victim were more likely to be female as age increased, likely due to the overall proportion of female residents increasing with age  Only 37% of incident reports carried details about the circumstances leading up to the incident  40% of incidents involved hitting another resident  Half of facilities surveyed for this report indicated they have indoor or outdoor walking circuits that help redirect residents with escalating behavior  There is no single, standardized incident report form used for the reporting of incidents across Health Authorities   The report recommends that resident to resident aggression be defined and tracked the same way across all residential care facilities and at a provincial level.  In addition, the OSA recommends a review of the adequacy of staffing for residents with more complex needs, specifically during busy times like dinner hours, when there is a noted spike in incidents.  It also recommends more comprehensive training for staff in relation to dealing with aggressive behaviors that includes standardized follow-up protocol. As well, the OSA recommends all facilities adopt strategies and design features that are known to be effective in mitigating aggressive behaviours including exploring the use of locking systems for private rooms to mitigate wandering behaviours.

These are the 26% of single seniors in British Columbia who are indeed living in poverty. These are people who have no expectation of increases in income with new jobs, no mobility to move to more affordable rental markets (20% of seniors in BC are renters) and 35% do not live in urban areas where house values provide potential significant equity to access. Some may question entitlements offered to seniors based solely on their age with no consideration of income.  However, in fact, almost all government subsidized entitlements for seniors are income tested. The social spending bias against seniors continues to be expressed by other media and some academics who cherry-pick data and offer gross generalizations that take the economic conditions of some seniors and apply it to all seniors. Perhaps the most offensive part of these often hyperbole laced arguments is when medical costs are considered.  The argument Ms. Wente and others advance is that we should be counting the money we spend on fixing hips, knees and hearts as part of looking at government expenditures on seniors, and lump it in with OAS and cinema discounts to conclude that we spend disproportionately more on seniors than the population under 65 on a per capita basis.  Not to let facts get in the way of a good story, but we could slice out any number of discrete populations and show similar healthcare dollar disparities.    Conveniently missing from the conversation on health care costs for seniors is the value of the contribution that seniors make to caring for their spouses.  Before we go blaming seniors for the fact they need a new hip or bypass surgery, we should first thank them for the billions, yes billions of dollars they save the health care system by taking care of each other.

Seniors Advocate underscores need for all seniors to file taxes   Victoria Œ B.C. Seniors Advocate is reinforcing the need for seniors in the province to file tax returns, even if they think they do not make enough income to file.   ﬁThere are many subsidies available to seniors that are based on income tax information,ﬂ said Isobel Mackenzie. ﬁIf seniors don™t file their taxes, low-income seniors in particular may be giving up opportunities to access subsidies which can make significant differences to their lives.ﬂ  The importance of filing taxes was highlighted in a recent case where the Federal Government found that 83,000 Canadian seniors, 13,000 of them in B.C., did not receive Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) payments for up to seven years because they did not file income tax for one or more years. The Federal Government is now fixing the problem and making retro-active payments to these low-income seniors. ﬁGIS is a key support for the lowest income seniors,ﬂ said Mackenzie.  ﬁThese are seniors living on $17,300 annually or less, however to receive this GIS, you must file an income tax return.ﬂ   In British Columbia, the median income of those over 65 is $24,000 and $22,000 for those over 75. Roughly one-quarter of senior homeowners have household incomes of less than $30,000. Approximately 35 percent of seniors who rent, have household incomes of less than $20,000. There are 54,000 seniors living on $17,000 or less annually. ﬁClearly there are many seniors in this province who are facing very challenging financial situations,ﬂ said Mackenzie.  ﬁFor these people, any financial support can result in life-changing outcomes, the ability to pay for a hearing aid, or uninsured dental care, or basic living expenses such as covering monthly rent.ﬂ  Mackenzie stresses it is important for seniors to know that there is help available to prepare income tax returns and it is free of charge for low-income seniors.

The report marks the beginning of what will become a yearly update from the OSA on the status of key seniors™ services in the province, highlighting where seniors™ needs are being met, and where improvements are most needed.   ﬁOur goal with this process is to provide the public and policy makers with a single source of data where they can compare year over year how we are doing in this province in delivering services that are critical to seniors,ﬂ said Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie. ﬁWhen we examined the data across all areas, we found a number of interesting stories that are starting to emerge, some are positive, some are cautionary, and some indicate the need for immediate improvements.ﬂ   Among areas that affect seniors positively, the report notes that 96% of seniors report they have a regular GP. Data also highlights that four out of five seniors over the age of 85 have no diagnosis of dementia. ﬁWhile the risk of dementia clearly increases with age it is very important to get the message out to seniors that they have greater likelihood of living a full life without developing dementia,ﬂ stated Mackenzie.  The report also outlines a number of areas of concern, most notably the number of incidents of resident on resident aggression in residential care facilities. Data presented in the report confirm there were between 425 and 550 incidents of resident on resident aggression that resulted in harm in residential care reported in 2014/15. Based on these findings, the Advocate will conduct a systemic review of resident on resident aggression this year.   ﬁWhile we have to remember this is still a small number when you consider there are more than 27,000 individuals in residential care at any given time in this province, the numbers are still substantial enough to warrant our office taking a closer look at this issue,ﬂ said Mackenzie.  ﬁWe are beginning in-depth research to see if there are particular patterns or systemic issues that contribute to an increased likelihood of resident on resident aggression,ﬂ continued Mackenzie.

Seniors Advocate States Transit Commission Decision Not to Increase Seniors™ Pass a Good First Step  Victoria Œ Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie applauded the decision of the Victoria Transit Commission not to increase the cost of a monthly seniors pass, but is still concerned about the overall cost of transit for low-income seniors.   ﬁGiven the timing and the information in front of them, I think the commission made the best decision that they could to support seniors,ﬂ stated Mackenzie who presented her concerns to the Commission at their public meeting in Victoria Monday.   Options being considered were increases of monthly seniors™ passes from the existing $540 a year to either $624 or $780 a year in respective fare review options.   Mackenzie is advocating a graduated fare that would align with ability to pay.  Currently seniors with an income of $17,280 or less and in receipt of the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), are eligible for the BC Bus Pass, which costs $45 annually.    ﬁMy concern is that if your income is just one dollar over the threshold, a senior immediately must pay the cost of the existing monthly bus pass, which at current prices, translates to $540 yearly, and that is quite a gap.ﬂ   A more progressive approach, says the Advocate, would see the amount a senior pays slowly increase from the $45 amount, as their income increases.  There is a current sliding scale formula in place for low-income seniors who access MSP Premium Assistance. The ceiling is $30,000 for all seniors in B.C.     ﬁTransit could develop a parallel program for purposes of establishing an annual pass for seniors that would allow seniors in receipt of premium assistance to qualify.  There would be no need for BC Transit to verify income, that is done when the senior qualifies for premium assistance.  The administrative burden would be very low and it would ensure that the greatest subsidy goes to those seniors in greatest need, which is a progressive approach to providing subsidies.ﬂ   Attached is a copy of Mackenzie™s presentation to the Victoria Transit Commission.

As B.C.™s Seniors Advocate, I am encouraging a celebration of our senior citizens in this province. It may be your dad, your mom, your grandparent, or maybe it™s you we are celebrating.  At the Office of the Seniors Advocate, we focus on systemic issues that affect a large number of seniors. We tackle housing and health care, gaps in home support, income support and transportation. So much of our work looks at what™s wrong when it comes to seniors, but today I want to focus on what™s right. And what is right are the truly astounding qualities I see in seniors as I travel to every corner of the province meeting with seniors face to face.  Today I urge you to celebrate the courage of seniors. The 80-year-old woman with severe arthritis who braves driving rain, but still walks several kilometres to and from the grocery story to get supplies for dinner. The father who decides to become a university student for the first time at 70. The widowed grandparent who steps up to parent a grandchild after raising five kids of her own.  Today is a day to celebrate the selflessness of seniors. In virtually every sector of society it™s easy to see this in action. Individual seniors want to help in the diverse communities they live in. According to StatsCan, Canadians 65 and over, volunteer on average 220 hours per year, higher than any age group. They do it not for their resumes or for graduation requirements, they do it for the most part, because they get a deep satisfaction from helping others. One look at the composition of our service groups tells us this kind of giving is being lost as time goes on.  What I am also reflecting on today is the profound commitment and tenacity I see in many of the seniors I meet. I think of the wife who traveled hours each day by bus to be with her husband at mealtimes. I remember the letter I received from an 83-year-old man who is caring for his wife with severe dementia, declining home support saying he just wants to be the one to put her to bed each night. The seniors I hear from know what they want and many of them are willing to fight, and fight hard to get what they feel they and their loved ones deserve.  I™d like us to also acknowledge another extraordinary quality that so many of our older citizens possess - an unbelievable ability to adapt to change, not just small shifts in the way things are done, but dramatic societal change on a global scale. The variety and magnitude of change that our older population has experienced is almost unfathomable Œ from streetcars to high-speed trains, brooms to vacuum robots, inkwells to iPads, courtship to online dating, and the list goes on.  The individual contributions of our seniors could fill this newspaper for decades to come. It™s these unique experiences of the older people in your life I invite you to celebrate today. Seniors are not all the same. Their likes and dislikes, choices and needs are as different at 80, as they were at 18. Today we aren™t celebrating ﬁseniorsﬂ we are celebrating Edna, Bev, Mohinder, Walter and the other 816,000 amazing individuals who happen to be over 65 living in this province. On this day, we say a heartfelt thank you to everything you offer all of us."

When we look at the data files for over 30,000 of our frailest seniors who are living in the community, we find their support system, which is based on having an unpaid caregiver in their life is strained, sometimes to the point of collapse.  all army of husbands and wives, sons and daughters and friends and neighbours, is often the last line of defence in a seniors battle to maintain their independence and we need to ensure we are supporting them in their paradoxically rewarding and exhausting caregiver role.  Evidence in the report highlights that 97% of seniors enrolled in the home support program, arguably  frailest seniors, have an unpaid caregiver in their life. Data shows that over half of these seniors have the same level of complex care needs as those who live in residential care, underscoring how challenging these caregiver roles can be.   There are many ways to support caregivers. Respite is one of the most fundamental supports and is offered to B.C. caregivers through three provincially funded programs. However, when the Office of the Seniors Advocate examined the data on these programs and cross-referenced them with distressed caregivers, it became obvious there are major gaps in the way respite is offered in the province.    Finded at adult day programs, home support and respite beds include:   29% of caregivers are in distress. This increases to 38% for those caring for seniors with complex care needs.   Unpaid caregivers provide an average of 19 hours of care per week. This increases to 30 hours per week for caregivers in distress.  54% of caregivers are caring for persons with complex needs, and thus would benefit from respite services such as an adult day program, home support or respite bed, yet of this group, only 8% used an adult day program in the last seven days, only 49% used home support in the last seven days and only 11% used a respite bed in the last year.  Clients with a distressed caregiver are less likely to have received a home support visit in the last seven days than clients without a distressed caregiver. There has been a reduction of clients and utilization in adult day programs in the last three years.  Home support services are not keeping pace with the aging population.  B.C. has seen a reduction in both the number of respite beds and the average length of stay in respite beds over the past three years.  B.C. has a 45% greater rate of caregiver distress than Alberta, yet Alberta seniors appear to be accessing more respite services.  B.C. is missing the opportunity to significantly reduce emergency department visits and in-patient hospital days by limiting its adult day programs.   Based on these findings, the Office of the Seniors Advocate is calling for increased access to adult day program spaces and respite beds as well as increases in the frequency of home support for clients with caregiver distress. The Advocate is also calling for more standardization of the assessment for respite services, increased consistency regarding respite fees and processes around waitlists, as well as standardized measurement tools for all types of respite services.   tter where a caregiver lives in this province, they should have access to respite services that truly Consistency is critical in maintaining optimum respite services and providing a solid foundation that enables us to track their efficacy. We need to do all that we can in this province to ensure distressed caregivers  The Office of the Seniors Advocate was established in 2014 and is an independent office of the provincial government with a mandate of monitoring and analyzing systemic issues that affect B.C. seniors.   -30-  Media contact: Sara Darling Director of Communications  Office of the Seniors Advocate 778-679-2588 sara.darling@gov.bc.ca"

Vancouver  Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie today released the reportAffordable, Appropriate, Available.proposes a bold new initiative to help senior homeowners afford to stay at home, calls for increases to rent subsidies for seniors, demands a commitment from the province to address lack of appropriate housing in rural B.C., argues for a fundamental redesign of assisted living, and presses for more action on opening the newly created Office of the Seniors Advocate in April 2014.  housing is not nearly as available or affordable as it needs to be to meet the needs of some seniorssaid Mackenzie. My team and I took this strongly voiced concern and looked at the evidence for three types of housing to determine the answer to these fundamental questions: Is it affordable? Is it appropriate?  Is it available? What we found very clearly is that improvements are critically needed.  The report highlights that 93% of seniors are living independently, and the help they need is mostly financial. In response to the overwhelming evidence of need on the part of low-income seniors, Mackenzie calls on the province to increase subsidies available through the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) program and to develop a strategy for creating more housing in rural B.C. concerned that some seniors are going without some of the basics in order to meet their rent obligations. There are many health costs, such as dental care and hearing aids, that are not covered. This can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of seniors For the 80% of seniors who are homeowners, Mackenzie has recommended a bold new initiative, a give low-income seniors the ability to defer paying housing costs such as hydro, home insurance, and major repairs and maintenance. The province would pay these expenses on behalf of the senior and then collect the money back when the house is sold.  at forces a senior out of a house they have loved for decades. Living in a house that is worth $500,000 or even a million dollars does not B.C., and you cThis kind of program would help seniors afford to live other recommendations are sweeping changes to Assisted Living program to allow seniors living in these settings to remain there as long as possible, even if their health care needs change.  assisted living could be accommodating more seniors than it egulations around assisted living are outdated and too restrictive and critically need to be re-designed, stated Mackenzie.  While residential care is appropriate for the majority of people who live there, strong evidence has emerged that some B.C. seniors are being referred to residential care prematurely.  Mackenzie first , , and she continues to provide the evidence in this report to support her recommendations on changes to assisted living and the screening criteria for placement in residential care.  The report also calls for the province to commit to meeting the standard of single room with ensuite bathroom for 95% of all beds by 2025 and recommends changes to the process of how seniors get to their preferred residential care facility.  and I think we can all agree that a room of your own with your own bathroom is really the standard for seniors in the 21st century Mackenzie.  While reaching this goal will take some time, something we can do immediately is enforce with Health Authorities their obligation to transfer seniors to the facility of choice as soon as possible. One of the biggest frustrations I have heard from the families of seniors in residential care is the lack of fairness and transparency in getting seniors to the facility of their choice. We need to better honour the commitment made to seniors when they accepted the first available bed to transfer them as soon as possible to the facility of their choice,, who recommends that health authorities be compelled to look at the transfer list first to fill vacancies.  Also aowners and strata property owners, discriminatory regulations on spousal definitions, the inequity of Home Adaptations for Independence (HAFI) grants, and protection for tenants against eviction due to live-in caregivers or non-structural unit modifications.   attached and the full report can be read at http://www.seniorsadvocatebc.ca/ Independent Housing Recommendations 1. Revise the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters Program (SAFER) to align with the subsidized housing model of tenants paying no more than 30% of their income for shelter costs, by: a. adjusting the maximum level of subsidy entitlement from the 90% currently indicated in the SAFER regulations to 100%; and b. replacing the current maximum rent levels used in the SAFER subsidy calculations with the average market rents for one- Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 2. Create a Homeowner Expense Deferral Account type program, as outlined in this report, to allow senior homeowners with low or moderate income to use the equity in their home to offset the costs of housing by deferring some or all of the major ongoing and exceptional expenses associated with home ownership until their house is sold. 3. Amend the Residential Tenancy Act and Strata Property Act to protect tenants and owners who require non-structural modifications to their unit (i.e. grab bars, flooring) from either eviction, fine or denial and protect their right to access grant money from the Home Adaptions for Independence (HAFI) program. 4. Amend both the Residential Tenancy Act and the Strata Property Act to ensure that tenants/owners cannot be evicted or fined under bylaw for the occupancy of their unit by a live-in caregiver. 5. Amend the Home Adaptations for Independence (HAFI) program to: exclude the value of the home as a criterion; graduate the grant on a decreasing scale relative to income; decrease complexity for landlord applications; and allow for applications from strata corporations and co-ops. 6. Amend the Strata Property Act and the Manufactured Home Act to ensure seniors who are placed either in residential care or subsidized Registered Assisted Living are able to rent their homes while they are listed for sale. 7. The Provincial Government consult with the Active Manufactured Home Owners Association, the Manufactured Home Park Owners Alliance of British Columbia and regional manufactured home owners associations to revise the Manufactured Home Act so that fair and equitable compensation is provided to manufactured home owners who are required to leave their home due to sale or development of the property. 8. The Provincial Government, BC Housing and the Office of the Seniors Advocate work together to develop a strategy for affordable and appropriate seniors housing in rural and remote British Columbia. 9. The Provincial Government work with the Federal Government on the issue of seniors who are homeless as a discrete population within the homeless community. 10. The Provincial Government work with the Office of the Seniors Advocate to raise awareness of all subsidy and grant programs available to seniors. Assisted Living Recommendations 11. Registered Assisted Living be fundamentally redesigned and regulations changed, to allow for a greater range of seniors to be accommodated and age in place as much as possible including palliative care. This should reduce: the number of discharges from Registered Assisted Living to Residential Care; the number of admissions to residential care of higher functioning seniors; and the number of seniors admitted directly to residential care from home with no home care. 12. Amend section 26(6) of the Community Care and Assisted Living Act to: a. allow that section 26(3) of the Act does not apply to a resident of assisted living if that person is housed in the assisted living facility with a person who is the spouse of the resident or anyone in the classes listed in section 16(1) of the Health Care (Consent) and Care Facility (Admission) Act and that person is able to make decisions on behalf of the resident. b. Provide that the -like relationship with the resident in addition to a person legally married to the resident. 13. The minimum amount of income with which a resident of subsidized assisted living is left be raised to $500 from the current $325 to recognize the costs that are not covered under Registered Assisted Living that are covered under Residential Care. Residential Care Recommendations 14. All health authorities adopt a policy that everyone assessed for admission to residential care who scores lower than three on either of the ADL Hierarchy or Cognitive Performance Scale on the InterRAI-HC or MDS 2.0 must receive an additional assessment to ensure all possible options for support in the community, either through home care or assisted living, have been exhausted. 15. All current residents in residential care whose latest InterRAI assessment indicates a desire to return to the community be re-assessed to ensure all possible options for support in the community, including additional supports for their caregiver and potential placement in assisted living are exhausted. 16. All health authorities immediately adopt a policy that any vacancies in residential care will be filled first from the preferred facility transfer list, and only after that has been exhausted will the bed be filled from the assessed and awaiting placement (AAP) list. Residents, if they choose, should be permitted to be placed on the transfer list for their preferred facility immediately upon admission to their first available bed. Residents and their family members should be regularly advised of: a. How many people are ahead of them on the waiting list for a preferred bed; and b. How many vacancies on average occur in the preferred facility. 17. The resident co-payment amount charged to residents who do not enjoy a single room must have a portion of their rate adjusted to reflect their lower grade accommodation. 18. The government commit that by 2025, 95% of all residential care beds in the province will be single room occupancy with ensuite bath and any newly built or renovated units meet the additional standard of shower in the ensuite washroom.

We Can Do Better. The report documents findings from the Advocate™s review of health assessment records from B.C.™s 25,000 seniors in residential care and 29,000 seniors receiving home care. These assessment records, called the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI), have never before been gathered, analyzed and reported on at the provincial level. The Advocate was also able to compare records for residential care with two other provinces, Alberta and Ontario.   ﬁIn my first high-level review of these data I have found three systemic issues that are of immediate concern,ﬂ said Mackenzie.   Firstly, assessments indicate that up to 15 per cent of B.C. seniors who are living in residential care may be incorrectly housed, with assisted living or community care being more appropriate options.   ﬁThis is troubling on a couple of fronts,ﬂ said Mackenzie, who worked in home care for 20 years. ﬁMost seniors would prefer to live independently than in residential care and so we want to ensure all supports and alternative living arrangements are exhausted before we move someone to residential care.ﬂ   In addition, the Advocate points to the scarcity of residential care beds, which is particularly acute in some parts of the province. ﬁIf we are filling even 5 per cent of these scarce beds with folks who could live independently, that is 1500 beds that could open up province-wide,ﬂ Mackenzie said.  The second issue that the data highlights is the overuse of medication, particularly antipsychotics. Thirty-four per cent of residential care clients are being prescribed antipsychotic medication, yet only 4 per cent have a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder. About 47 per cent of residential care clients are being prescribed antidepressant medications, while only 24    per cent of these clients have actually been assessed as having depression. ﬁThis is a sizeable gap between diagnosis and prescription,ﬂ said Mackenzie. ﬁWe should be asking serious Office of the Seniors Advocate  2  questions, given the side-effects of these drugs, as to whether they are the most appropriate for the seniors in question.ﬂ   The third issue is the significant lack of rehabilitative therapies in B.C.™s residential care facilities compared to Alberta and Ontario.   ﬁGetting seniors moving properly and keeping them moving is absolutely key to maintaining function and independence. The downward spiral can begin very quickly if a frail senior is immobilized in bed for a week or more and having trained staff to work with them in recovery and building back strength is fundamental,ﬂ said Mackenzie. ﬁFor this reason I was really very disappointed to see how far B.C. lags in this area.ﬂ    The number of seniors who received physiotherapy, for example, was 12 per cent in B.C. as compared to 25 per cent in Alberta and 58 per cent in Ontario.    ﬁEqually important is on-going recreational therapy that ensures seniors in residential care are engaged in activities and experience meaningful social engagement,ﬂ continued Mackenzie, who noted that only 22 per cent of seniors received any recreational therapy in the last seven days, when they were assessed, compared to 42 per cent in Alberta.   The Office of the Seniors Advocate will be addressing these, and other emerging systemic issues that affect seniors in several upcoming reports. The Advocate™s review of seniors™ housing in the province will be released in late spring. A systemic review of home and community care is underway. The Office is also currently planning the first independent survey of residential care clients in the province, the results of which will help inform an in-depth review of residential care in British Columbia.

Œ Results from a recent survey conducted by B.C.™s Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie show seniors are often unaware of key programs currently in place to support them. ﬁWe were surprised to learn of the lack of awareness among seniors, particularly low-income seniors, of government programs and subsidies available to assist them,ﬂ Mackenzie said. ﬁThis is a reminder that it is not sufficient to provide supports. The results of the survey clearly show we need to do a better job of connecting seniors, particularly low-income and older seniors, with subsidies available to them.ﬂ  Premium Assistance, which subsidizes MSP premiums, is an example where seniors living on $22,000 or less could save up to $864 per year, yet 60% of seniors surveyed, living on $30,000/year or less,  reported they don™t know about the program.  The survey, conducted in late 2014, surveyed seniors™ knowledge and awareness of a range of programs and grants designed to support them, including the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER), Medical Service Plan Premium Assistance, Fair Pharmacare, Property Tax Deferment Program, Home Adaptations for Independence and the federal Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) programs. Across the board, the survey showed that awareness was lowest among the seniors over the age of 75 and those with incomes of less than $30,000/year. ﬁEven those seniors who access subsidies are struggling, so I can only imagine how much greater the challenges are for those who aren™t accessing their entitlements,ﬂ said Mackenzie. The survey also found a high number of seniors, particularly low-income seniors, reported they would need to move in the future because they would not be able to afford to remain in their home. At the same time, a high percentage believed that the provision of daily home support would allow them to age in place. ﬁThose of us who work in home and community care have always believed that increasing support was the key to allowing seniors to remain at home. However, it appears we have missed a crucial piece, which is affordable housing for seniors to live in while they are receiving these supports,ﬂ says Mackenzie.  ﬁThe results of the survey reinforce what I am hearing from seniors and is a focus of our first systemic report on housing, where we are looking across the housing continuum from independent housing to assisted living, to residential care, and asking three key questions Œ is this type of housing affordable, accessible and appropriate?ﬂ   Among the many issues in the survey, the Office of the Seniors Advocate also probed the degree to which seniors had benefit programs to help to defray costs for ancillary health care needs such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, mobility aids and dental care. Overall, 50% of seniors reported having some form of benefit coverage, but 65% of those with household incomes below $30,000 said they had no coverage. 2  ﬁThis means that low-income seniors, the ones with the least amount of disposable income, are also the least likely to be covered for key ancillary health care needs,ﬂ said Mackenzie. ﬁI continue to be concerned about low-income seniors™ lack of access to ancillary health supports.ﬂ  The Seniors Advocate Survey, conducted in conjunction with B.C. Stats and HealthLink BC, had 506 respondents. The sample size will yield a margin of error of no more than +/- 4.38% and is reflective of demographic groupings in the province.  The Office of the Seniors Advocate was established in March of 2014 to serve as an independent voice and go-to resource for seniors™ issues. The Advocate will work with seniors, stakeholders and service providers to identify and understand systemic challenges facing seniors and make independent recommendations for changes to address those issues.

On Oct. 1, 2014, we celebrated the United g No One Behind: temptation to stereotype anyone, including seniors. To this end, there has been much discussion in the media recently about the increased and relative struggled to find the voice of actual seniors reflected. What I have found instead is incomplete information that has resulted in a mis-representation of the economic plight of many seniors. Statistics Canada pegs the 2011 median income for those over 65 at $23,700. This means that 50% of seniors in Canada are living on less than $23,700 per year, with the majority living alone. Compare this to the median income for 35-44 year olds at $43,300 with the overwhelming majority living in a two-person household sharing costs that are often borne by the single senior. Here in British Columbia alone, we have over 52,000 seniors who are living on $16,300 per year or less. While it is true that some low-income seniors live in a home with no mortgage, they still face property tax, insurance and maintenance and repair costs all on a fixed income that is often not guaranteed to keep pace with inflation. Their equity in some cases has either been borrowed senior households that are rented and face annual increases against an often stagnant income. Seniors face health-care costs related to drugs, mobility aids, dental care, eyeglasses and hearing aids with no workplace benefit plans to defray costs. Householders today are enjoying record low interest rates. While this is a boon for some homeowners, it can be a hardship for the overwhelming majority of seniors who do not receive a defined benefit pension plan and must produce an adequate retirement income from savings and investments. It is important to remember that, whatever wealth seniors might have (outside of their primary residence) they are usually required to produce an income from it, unlike people who receive their income from employment and can allow their wealth to compound. The issue of the low income and poverty of some seniors is only one part of the picture. Seniors also make significant contributions to our communities and our health-care system. We know that the greatest amount of volunteering is done by seniors. More significantly perhaps is the millions of hours of care that is provided every year in this country by seniors to their spouses, their community, the cost to all levels of government would be staggering. The contribution of unpaid caregivers over 65, alone is an estimated four billion dollar savings to the Canadian health care system. In addition to their contributions of unpaid labour, seniors also contribute to the costs of their care. In B.C., seniors pay: 80% of their income toward the cost of residential care to a maximum of $3092.66; 70% of their income toward the cost of government subsidized assisted living with a maximum that varies according to local market conditions; and they co-pay the costs of their home support on a sliding scale based on income. While it may be fair to question whether a minority of higher income seniors should benefit from the caps, it is also very evident that the majority of seniors are surrendering significant amounts of their income to subsidize their care needs. The seniors of today, like the seniors of tomorrow, are unique individuals. Some have money, some do not. Some have good health, some do not. Some contribute to their community, others less so. Some need our help, others do not. What is most important is that we value the uniqueness of seniors just as we do those who are not yet 65 and in so doing, ensure we leave no one behind and create a society for all.

Seniors Week 2014 (pdf, 448 KB)","Seniors Week in B.C.OPINION-EDITORIAL€By Isobel MackenzieSeniors Advocate (601 words)June 5, 2014VICTORIA Œ The week of June 2, 2014, has been proclaimed Seniors Week in British Columbia.As I have been travelling the province and meeting with seniors, I am reminded that age is no barrier to what one can do for oneself and what one can do for others.€ Many seniors have needs that are genuine and legitimate, but we also must remember and recognize the contribution that seniors make and the value they add to our communities. When we really think about it, seniors give and contribute much more to society then they get in return.€ Yes, it is important to thank our seniors for what they have done. They have fought in wars, helped to build our country and have broken any number of social and racial barriers, but it is equally important to thank them for what they are continuing to do each day for us and for each other. If in doubt, just think what would happen in this province if everyone over the age of 65 simply ﬁdowned toolsﬂ for the day. It is seniors who are volunteering in our community centres, delivering meals on wheels, fundraising for housing, serving on boards of directors of community organizations, organizing church functions and providing care for a spouse and often grandchildren, just to name a few.€ Without the efforts and contributions that seniors continue to make long after they have left the paid workforce, our governments at the federal, provincial and local levels would be faced with a massive bill for the services they would need to pay people to provide. Seniors are a varied bunch, just as they were before they turned 65. While many are volunteering and serving as caregivers, many are also continuing to blaze a trail. Age is just a number, not an indication of ability or ambition. Just ask Mick Jagger, a great-grandfather at the age of 70, or Clint Eastwood, who is directing his latest movie at the age of 84. Nelson Mandela was 75 when he was elected President of South Africa. ﬁGrandma Mosesﬂ first picked up a paintbrush at the age of 76 and was still working on her art, which hangs in Connect with the Province of B.C. at: www.gov.bc.ca/connectMedia Relations Office of the Seniors Advocate 250 952-1887Media Contact:museums in Vienna and Paris, at the age of 99. Doris Haddock was 89 when she began the 5,000-kilometre walk from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., and 90 when she finished it 14 months later.€ Right here in B.C. I met Mae Irving at the South Granville Seniors Centre, where they were hosting her 102nd birthday lunch, but not until she had completed her exercise class, where she was able to keep up with women 20 years younger. That would be 82!These and many other age-oblivious accomplishments should be sharp reminders to those of us who help shape policies that seniors are perfectly able to know what they want and that it will not be the same for everyone.The number one desire of seniors is to remain as independent as possible for as long as possible and recognizing that independence looks different for different people. As we celebrate seniors, let™s remember not just what they have done, but what they are doing and can do.Most seniors want to help themselves and others. It is our collective responsibility to ensure they have the tools, supports and services to realize their full potential. For those seniors who require greater care and protection, we must ensure that they can live with dignity in a safe and comfortable environment.€ Today it may be our mother, grandmother or great grandmother, but someday it will be us."

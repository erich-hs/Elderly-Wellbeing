0,"Feb 11, 2022","It might have taken Ganesh Gopan a year or more to scratch together the $10,000 or so it costs to train to be a health care assistant. But thanks to a new provincial aid program that covers tuition and pays students $21-an-hour to attend the nine-month program, Gopan is a couple of months away from graduating from college as a home support worker. “Eventually, yes,” Gopan said that he would have found a way to enrol, “but it would have taken a lot more time for me to raise money. I would have had to work multiple jobs and save for quite a while.” The Health Career Access Program (HCAP), launched by the Ministry of Health last summer, is designed to address a provincewide shortage of home-support workers andhealth-care assistants for long-term care and seniors’ assisted living facilities by making training accessible. Last year’s provincial budget provided $195 million a year (for three years) to the HCAP program to train, recruit and employ approximately 3,000 health care workers annually, including staff forhome health services owned and operated by health authorities. As of Feb. 9, 2,254 recruits were in the midst of their training or had completed training through the program. Gopan’s passion for health care began at age 13, after a serious cycling accident in which he suffered multiple fractures that forced him to be bedridden for two months. “It was a big jolt in my life, which made me stop and think for a moment,” said Gopan, 33. While he was lying in bed recuperating and getting rehabilitation assistance from others, he saw another side of life. “I started looking at people around me from a new perspective, filled with more love and respect.It taught me valuable lessons in life. “From that day onwards, it filled me with happiness whenever I could help another person or bring joy to their life from giving them a genuine good compliment or … being part of humanitarian volunteering opportunities around where I lived. This gradually led me to pursue a career in health care,” the Surrey resident said. The HCAP opportunity, Gopan was happy to discover, allows him to shadow a mentor in the field during a practicum that takes place during the program, rather than at the end. “I can observe how she deals with the clients, how she takes care of them,” he said. “So when I go back to class, when the teachers are talking about different aspects of care and how to do (one thing) and how not to do (another) I can relate to everything, which is a big, big blessing.” A further benefit is guaranteed employment after graduation. Gopan, for example, has a contract through February 2023 after his April graduation. “So we have that insurance, while we’re investing that time of our life into this program, that we will have a job afterward,” he said. While seniors aren’t the only people who require home care, they’re a burgeoning percentage of the population that does, so the key questions are: Is HCAP a good thing for seniors and is it enough? “The first one I can answer, the second one I need more information,” saidIsobel Mackenzie. B.C.’s seniors advocate. “The first answer is yes, it’s a good thing.” B.C. needs to increase the pool of workers who provide health-care assistance, whether it’s in people’s homes or in long-term care, she said. And there’s a greater shortage of workers who provide care in people’s homes. “The problem we’ve got right now, or before HCAP, was …you had to go and get yourself trained, pay for that, and then get a job,” said Mackenzie. “For a lot of people the ability to quit their job, go and pay $10,000 for the program was problematic.” Mackenzie, who has been B.C.’s seniors advocate since 2014, has heard from tens-of-thousands of seniors about the diverse issues that matter to them, and if there’s one issue on which they hold a near-unanimous opinion it’s their desire to live independently in their own homes for as long as possible. Some of the acute problems in home care at the moment have been caused by COVID-19, such as workers having to stay home for five days if they test positive for COVID or don’t feel well. Though the pandemic will pass some day, the growing demand for home care won’t go away, and that demand wasn’t being met even pre-COVID, Mackenzie said, so the jury is out on whether HCAP is enough. “These are relatively early days, but the concept is good, the intent excellent, and I hope it works. It takes a certain kind of person. Some of the client visits are very pleasant, the houses are very nice, the people are nice, the equipment is there. Others not so nice.” Homecare workers, whose wages range from $23.27 to $25.45 an hour, face challenges that health-care assistants who go to one site every day don’t, saidNuzhat Jamal, regional lead for strategic community initiatives at Fraser Health. They need a car to reach clients and they’ve got to make their rounds in conditions such as Novembers floods in the Fraser Valley and the snow that walloped the Lower Mainland around Christmas time. They also work alone. “The thing with homecare workers is that they’re typically more vulnerable because they’re not in a facility, they’re not surrounded by colleagues, they’re out there doing the work on their own in clients’ homes,” saidJamal.“Some of the homes they go into, the people are quite socially vulnerable and more marginalized. “Also, with our snowstorms, our floods in the Fraser Valley, our workers are out there driving around and it’s not just about getting from Point A to Point B, you know from home to a hospital or to a long-term-care facility, they need those roads open.” The work schedule can also be unpredictable. “You can go to bed at night thinking you have three visits the next day but when you show up for work, you’re told you have seven,” she said. Home-care workers, who provide clients with personal care such as bathing, dressing and mobility, are vital to help many seniors remain at home as long as possible, saidCheryl Beach, executive director of Fraser Health’s integrated home health services. The demand for home support services has grown 10 per cent since March 2020. “We are challenged to hire the workforce to keep up with this demand,” said Beach. Home care wasn’t originally going to be part of HCAP. It was first designed to focus only on training for long-term-care workers in assisted living facilities and acute-care workers in hospitals, until Beach and several of her counterparts across B.C. told the Health Ministry: “Hey, we really need this in home care, as well,” she said. “Home care is what keeps people living in their community if they’re frail seniors, for example, or people with physical or cognitive challenges,” Beach said. “There are times, obviously, when people need to go to hospital and there are times when people do need to get care in a facility. What we want to do is keep people healthy at home because I think people are happier. “I feel maybe in the past there’s been under-recognition of the role (home-care workers) play and I think this program really emphasizes the importance of their role in the community and that we really need them.” She describes HCAP as building bridges, from education to practical application, by reducing the financial burden for workers. The program — offered throughprivate schools and community colleges— aims to attract young people: There’s no student debt after graduation and the job is a potential springboard to other health-care fields such as nursing. As the population ages, it’s those young people who are needed, Beach said. “I think many people don’t know about community health workers and the huge service that they provide to individuals unless they’ve experienced it themselves,” Beach said. “These community health workers are the heart and soul, the backbone of our community services that help people stay at home.” B.C., unlike say Alberta or Ontario, charges individuals for publicly subsidized home support, noted seniors advocate Mackenzie: “It’s a bone of contention with me, because we charge a lot.” In Mackenzie’s 2019 report,Home Support: We Can Do Better, looked at costs and other issues, she found: • About 4,200 long-term-care beds were occupied by seniors who could have been living in the community had they had home support and/or assisted living; • Community health workers providing home support are paid less than aides in other health sectors and have the highest rate of casual work (more than three-quarters are part-time or casual); • At the time the report was written, 94 per cent of British Columbians aged 65-or-older lived independently and, at 85 years old, that drops to 72 per cent; but almost one-third of community-dwelling seniors live with chronic conditions of medium complexity and another 20 per cent with chronic conditions of high complexity (40 per cent for those 85-and-older); • A senior with $28,000 income pays $8,800 a year for subsidized daily home support (31.4 per cent of income), leaving barely $19,000 to cover annual housing, food, medicinal, clothing and telecommunications costs; • The cost to taxpayers to subsidize a long-term care bed is estimated at $57,600 per year; the cost of two hours of daily home support is $27,740 per year; and • Slightly more than half of B.C.’s home support clients were at high or very-high risk of placement in long-term care, but 86 per cent of the total got less than two hours of home support a day on average. The seniors advocate has had experience with projects similar to HCAP, though on a smaller-scale, when she used to work for a community-based non-profit group serving southern Vancouver Island. Those projects led to a very low attrition rate and happy, motivated workers, she said. “We did, in my time, little versions of this kind of project and they’re highly effective,” Mackenzie said. “I think supporting people to get the training, supporting them financially to get them through, that is really important.” gordmcintyre@postmedia.com twitter.com/gordmcintyre More news, fewer ads, faster load time:Get unlimited, ad-lite access to the Vancouver Sun, the Province, National Post and 13 other Canadian news sites for just $14/month or $140/year.

1,"Feb 02, 2022","Pickleball has exploded in popularity over the past decade in B.C., especially during COVID, but lines are being drawn between enthusiasts and residents who consider its noise a nuisance. Complaints over the noise generated by players have led to rising tensions — a Coquitlam resident who wants limits on play on courts across from her condo said players have dropped the f-bomb on her while she was on her balcony — and the ball usually ends up in the court of the municipality. “Especially during the past two years, with COVID, pickleball exploded and every city is facing the same issue: What do we do with the pickleball players and where are we going to put them?” said Julie McRitchie, president of the PoCoMo Pickleball Club in the Tri-Cities. Finding space in cities with sky-high land prices would be a problem for any sport, let alone a noisy one. No one disputes the sharp rap of its perforated plastic ball is loud. Add to the mix a lot of on-court social interaction as most games are played as doubles on a small court. There can be as many as six courts and 24 players on one tennis court, and that is a lot of back-and-forth “toks.” “I can understand it gets a little annoying in the summertime when people are playing at 8 a.m.,” said Walter Knecht, president of Pickleball B.C., which has 8,600 members and grows at 20 per cent a year. “I personally have played as late as 9:30 at night (in non-residential areas). It is a concern and in a few cases we have had pickleball courts closed because of the noise. “We just don’t have enough space for all the people who want to play.” West Vancouver council voted last week to close three courts at the end of April while they find a replacement site, and Port Moody has made a similar decision. In Coquitlam, the opposite happened. A group of condo-dwellers led by one persistent opponent won only a partial victory at Blue Mountain Park when the city agreed to install acoustic baffling, and to limit the number of courts and hours of play. Connie Ball, 66, a stroke survivor who lives on the third floor, said the baffling mitigated only noise at ground level about 50 per cent, and players ignore time limits. Her calls to bylaw officers are met with promises to “proactively educate” and not fine. “It’s like gunshots,” she said. “Baffles do not help.” She said her complaints are being dismissed because she is one of a group of 12 condo-dwellers affected compared to 300-plus members in the PoCoMo Pickleball Club. “We know there are differences in how people perceive noise,” said Coquitlam Mayor Richard Stewart. “I am sympathetic to the fact that she is living across from something that is irritating to her and our goal is to find a solution.” Coquitlam parks is updating its tennis and pickleball strategy to present to council in a month or so, because during COVID participation in both sports surged, said parks manager Kathleen Reinheimer. The city has opened courts at Bramble Park and has so far had no noise complaints. But, “We have very few choices for pickleball courts where the noise won’t be an issue for adjacent buildings,” Reinheimer said. In West Vancouver, council faces a revolt from the players after voting at its last meeting to permanently close all three pickleball courts as of April 30, after first limiting hours of play and posting a sign asking players to “please use the quietest equipment possible.” “I do empathize, it does make a lot of noise,” said Richard Thorpe, 82, of the West Van Players group. His group is calling on council to reconsider the closing or provide a temporary location until a suitable permanent location can be developed. His group is planning a letter-writing campaign, and may even put up their own nets on a few tennis courts. “That would be our next step if nothing happens.” West Vancouver Mayor Mary-Ann Booth said in an email that council has tried to integrate the game into tennis courts, but the city is residential and “it’s become quite clear this sport is not compatible with most neighbourhoods. It really needs a dedicated space where it won’t be so disruptive to others.” Council is studying a few possible locations. Pickleballers said the sport will grow, especially once it catches on beyond seniors, and it will need facilities. “(Accessibility issues) will get resolved when we get our own courts and not have to share with tennis courts,” said McRitchie. Knecht said based on a 12-court facility with a roof built in Vernon on donated city land, a similar facility in Metro Vancouver would need $2.5 million and 40,000 square feet of land. Vernon has 700 players and is facing a cap on membership, and based on those numbers, Metro Vancouver could easily fill four 12-court facilities, he said. “Pickleball is not going away,” said Knecht."
2,"Jan 29, 2022","There are 600,000 empty COVID-19 appointment slots in B.C. About 48,000 people 70-and-older, those most at-risk of serious illness and death, who are eligible for a booster, haven’t booked an appointment. And the uptake of children getting vaccinated is stalling. After a strong response when vaccines were first approved and available to kids in December 2020, the amount of children getting vaccinated has shrunk each week, according to information from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control. B.C. just passed the 50 per cent mark. And in some areas, the uptake remains much lower. In Peace River North it’s just 17 per cent. That’s well behind provinces like Newfoundland where more than 80 per cent of five-to-11-year-olds have a first dose. B.C. provincial health officials continue to encourage everyone who isn’t vaccinated to do so — and for British Columbians to get a third booster jab to renewprotection from waning vaccine efficacy. But as the hundreds-of-thousands of empty appointment slots show, it’s not an issue of capacity. Dr. Marie Tarrant, a professor in the school of nursing at the University of B.C. Okanagan, said there are likely a number of reasons for vaccine hesitancy in children and the uptake of boosters that include mixed messaging, vaccine concerns that haven’t been addressed, convenience and access. She noted that earlier during the pandemic the messaging was that children were less-susceptible and not likely to get very ill — and schools were safe. “We see all through the pandemic, the inconsistencies in messaging is something that people just pick up on right away,” said Tarrant, whose areas of expertise include vaccine uptake and hesitancy. Last week,the National Advisory Committee on Immunization revisedtheir language on vaccinating five-to-11-year-olds from “may” be offered to children to “should.” The advisory group said they strengthened their recommendation after a review of safety data around the world. Tarrant said there is a bigger role for primary caregivers such as family doctors and pediatricians to play in addressing parents’ concerns. And bringing clinics to schools could be helpful, as clinics outside of school may not be convenient for all parents, she said. Similar issues could be at play for seniors who aren’t getting their boosters, a belief that fully vaccinated means two doses and a booster is optional, noted Tarrant. Provincial health officials will also have very specific data on where the gaps are — and should come up with a plan to address those, she said. Other jurisdictions are facing similar challenges,including in the U.S,where vaccine uptake for the five-to-11-year-old group has also stalled. B.C. health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has said there are lessons that can be learned from Newfoundland. In Newfoundland, clear communication, a culture of vaccine acceptance and a quick rollout are credited with its high vaccine rate for children. Vaccines have been available at public clinics but also at schools there. Henry has noted that with the takeover of the highly transmissible Omicron variant,more kids are getting infectedand they can get “really” sick even if they don’t end up in hospital. Henry said they’re working on initiatives to increase the uptake of vaccines in children, including working with family doctors about how the province can involve them more in providing vaccinations for young kids. In some communities, health officials are reaching out through schools to give opportunities for younger children, and all school-aged children, to get vaccinated, Henry said. In the next age group up, 12-to-17-year-olds, the uptake has been at much higher levels. Nearly 90 per cent have had one vaccine dose, and 84 per cent have had two. The rates are lowest in northern B.C., where 71 per cent have had one dose and 65 per cent have had two. ghoekstra@postmedia.com twitter.com/gordon_hoekstra"
3,"Jan 26, 2022","B.C.’s Ministry of Environment and the Northern Health authority issued an air quality advisory on Wednesday for Vanderhoof and Houston. The ministry says stagnant winter conditions created “elevated pollution levels,” which can be dangerous for some, and it suggested people stay indoors to limit exposure. It did not provide a timeline but says high concentrations of fine particulate matter were expected to persist until weather conditions change. Fog advisories were also issued for Vancouver Island, the Sunshine Coast, Metro Vancouver, and the central and western Fraser Valley. The ministry says dense fog was expected to lift Wednesday afternoon before redeveloping overnight. It says visibility may be reduced to near zero and it urged drivers to slow down, watch for tail lights and be prepared to stop.

4,"Jan 22, 2022","Without foreign-trained nurses, health-care aides and doctors, Canada’s health-care system would have collapsed decades ago. Since the 1980s, the percentage of foreign-trained health-care workers in the country has remained relatively steady. Currently, immigrants account for nearly a third of nurses and care aides, and a quarter of all physicians. These are a big wins for Canada and substantial, potentially devastating losses to source countries in Asia and Africa. The Philippines, for example, is in a crisis. It has long been one of Canada’s primary sources of internationally educated nurses, and Saskatchewan is currently recruiting there. But by 2030, the World Health Organization predicts that there will be nearly 250,000 nursing jobs in the Philippines that will be unfilled. In 2001, Canada’s active recruitment of doctors resulted in a rebuke from South Africa’s high commissioner. Within a year, the number of South African doctors working in Saskatchewan alone had doubled to 1,530. At the time, one in five doctors there was South African-trained. This ethical dilemma of scarce human resources moving from poor countries with fragile health-care systems to benefit the wealthy was the reason behind the WHO’s 2010Medical Recruitment Code of Practice. Yet the riddle is itself embedded in the code’s stated principles. Everyone has a right to the highest attainable standard of health. And all individuals, including health workers, have the right to migrate from one country to another in search of employment. So which takes precedence? Canada was among the first 193 countries to sign on to the code of practice. It was nothing more than well-intentioned window dressing. That’s because Canada doesn’t have a single health-care system — it has a patchwork of different systems run by the provinces and territories. It’s so decentralized that it was the reason Canada previously declined to sign a similar Commonwealth Medical Recruitment Code of Practice. Ottawa’s powerlessness is reflected in the WHO’s 2014assessment of the code’s efficacy. In four years, all Canada had done was “raise awareness of the code among foreign workers entering the country at embassies and high commissions.” While the national government may not be actively seeking health-care workers, Canada’s immigration policies amount to passive recruitment. Immigration applicants with medical training are given preference because of the shortages, while the live-in caregivers’ program offers a promise of permanent residency and has become a major pathway for Filipino nurses into Canada. It’s hard to know exactly how many foreign-trained health-care workers are in Canada because the data only counts those currently working. The statistics don’t reflect the reality that there are hundreds, if not thousands, in Canada (including Canadians who trained abroad) sidelined as they wait for their credentials to be assessed. Regulatory barriers are essential to ensuring Canadians get high-quality care. But it can take years and thousands of dollars to leap them, resulting in many — by necessity — taking lower-paid and lower-skilled jobs or moving to more welcoming countries. Essentially, Canada is hoarding and squandering that potential in the midst of two crisis — a pandemic and a worldwide shortage of health-care workers. By 2030, just eight years from now, the WHO forecasts a global shortage of 5.7 million nurses. Regardless of whether Canada actively recruits or passively accepts them, Oxford research fellow Nazrul Islam wrote that it faces a moral dilemma because the outcome is the same — “a deleterious impact on the health-care system of the poorer ‘donor’ countries.”Islam’s paperwas published in the International Journal of Health Policy and Management, while he was doing a doctorate at the University of B.C. Rather than focusing on lessening the damage recruitment does in other countries, Islam said Canada’s “overarching interest” should reduce reliance on international medical graduates, train more of its own physicians, and do a better job of recruiting and retaining them for under-served, rural and remote communities. His advice framed within an ethical context went largely unheeded. Now that the pandemic has refocused attention on the problems, the solutions proposed are virtually the same. But they are offered from an economic rather than an ethical perspective. “Large pools of talent remain under-utilized in Canada,”RBC Economicsnoted in December. Those pools included Indigenous people, women and immigrants. Closing the immigrant employment and wage gap could potentially add $50 billion a year to Canada’s gross domestic product, while closing the participation gap for women who are already here would add 1.2 million to the workforce. And it bears pointing out that 91 per cent of Canada’s registered nurses are women, as are 89 per cent of our care aides and nearly half of the country’s physicians. The Conference Board of Canada hasraised concernsabout Canada’s ability to both fill essential jobs and provide “quality opportunities” for immigrants and temporary residents. Noting that nearly 45 per cent of nurses’ aides, orderlies and “patient services associates” are over-qualified for the essential work that they are doing, it urged Canada to speed up the credentialing process, provide essential workers with better pay and benefits, and ensure that there is on-the-job “reskilling and upskilling”. The conference board also said that immigration policies need to be realigned so that not only are there enough people to fill essential jobs, but they are right people with the right skills in the right jobs. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne More news, fewer ads, faster load time:Get unlimited, ad-lite access to the Vancouver Sun, the Province, National Post and 13 other Canadian news sites for just $14/month or $140/year.

5,"Jan 17, 2022","Chetwynd’s hospital was once again diverting patients an hour away to Dawson Creek last week, while a critical shortage of health-care workers at Nicola Valley Hospital forced the closure of its emergency department. Because there are no lab technicians, Fort Nelson General Hospital has to ship blood and other samples four hours south to Fort St. John for processing. And that hospital has its own challenges. When COVID’s fourth wave was cresting last September, Fort St. John’s emergency room was short 15 nurses. Five nurses kept it running with the help of colleagues working overtime or pulled in from other areas. But sometimes that left a lone nurse in other wards of the hospital that has 44 acute care beds, three intensive-care units, and serves a population of more than 22,000. This is a snapshot of primary health care outside B.C.’s major cities, where alarming, long-standing shortages of health-care workers have been exacerbated by the pandemic. The Northern Health Authority services close to 300,000 people sprinkled over two-thirds of the province. It’s an area roughly the size of France. Resources are the backbone of the regional economy. But while it has one of the youngest populations in the province, many people work in high-risk jobs, which means more accidents. Northern Health also has one of the highest number of opioid overdose deaths per capita. Its shortage of nurses is chronic. When the B.C. auditor-general looked into the inability of rural and remote areas to recruit and retain them,the reportnoted that in 2017, Northern Health was short 121 full-time registered nurses — 15 per cent of its nursing workforce. Plus, it needed at least six nurse practitioners. The auditor concluded that some of the challenges — weather, isolation, limited amenities — were beyond the authority’s control. Some weren’t. A few of the auditor’s recommendations to address those have been implemented. Staff now work in inter-professional teams, for example, and the University of Northern B.C. and community colleges now have nursing certificate programs. But shortages persist.Health Match B.C.lists 76 vacancies for family physicians and specialists, 32 full-time nursing vacancies, 18 nurse practitioners, four occupational therapists, and two hospital pharmacists. Long-term care homes also have vacancies, but those aren’t listed on Health Match. It has led to a request from local mayors and Peace River North MLA Dan Davies that Health Minister Adrian Dix order another independent inquiry. “Our medical system is on life support because we are so critically short of doctors, lab techs, nurses, you name it,” Davies said in an interview. “Nurses are burning out, taking more leave and putting more stress on folks remaining. … We’re at a tipping point.” His concern about the deteriorating care available in the north doesn’t just reflect what he’s being told by constituents. It’s informed by his own experience of beingcritically injured a few years ago while working as a truck driver at an industrial site. Local medical professionals stabilized him before he was flown to Vancouver for treatment. Without them, who knows what might have happened. Although immigrants comprise nearly a quarter of Canada’s health workforce and have long been a mainstay in rural health care, the 2018 audit didn’t mention them. A 2020 report by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Society of Rural Physicians of Canada that did a five-year review of rural physician recruitment and retention programs reached the same conclusion as B.C.’s auditor: Provinces and territories have made little or no progress either in terms of recruiting doctors or retaining them. But like the auditor’s report, the physicians’ review ignored the potential of international medical graduates. Since COVID, the B.C. government also rarely mentions them — not even last September when itallocatedan additional $6.38 million aimed at helping rural and remote communities attract nurses and doctors. With the situation so dire, Davies can’t understand why. “Folks already in Canada who come from a health background are working in service industry jobs,” he said. “But the hoops and blockages in place (that keep them from getting medical accreditation) are huge in this province. “We need to look at those barriers. How can we get those trained people already in the country working? We should be making sure that there is an easier entry point.” Other provinces deemed less attractive to immigrating doctors and health-care workers certainly are. In the past few weeks, some have announced plans to actively recruit nurses overseas, as well as streamlining accreditation procedures. Some already allow physicians to qualify for licensure that doesn’t require doing a medical residency. But whether B.C. is doing anything isn’t clear. Questions emailed last week remain unanswered due to “a significant number of media requests.” For years, rural and remote communities have limped along and residents’ cries from afar largely ignored. Now, the crisis threatens everybody, every hospital and long-term care home. On Friday, Fraser Health announced“an extended diversion” of maternity patientsfrom Peace Arch Hospital to Langley due to a shortage of pediatricians. Earlier in the week, LifeLabs closed 11 of its laboratories in Metro Vancouver and limited the hours at five others for two weeks because it hasn’t got enough staff. The fact is that without health-care workers, there is no health care. And that’s something that is becoming very hard to ignore. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne More news, fewer ads, faster load time:Get unlimited, ad-lite access to the Vancouver Sun, the Province, National Post and 13 other Canadian news sites for just $14/month or $140/year.

6,"Jan 16, 2022","If Canada trained more nurses, it would help with the increasingly dire shortages. If nurses were paid more, it might also help. Yet, even taken together, that wouldn’t come close to solving the fundamental problem. Canada simply doesn’t have enough young people to replace the number of health care workers who are retiring, let alone take care of the rising number of old people. Since 2010, when the first of the baby boomers turned 65, Canada’s labour force has declined by about a million. It’s led to critical shortages in many sectors. But devastatingly, the shortage of health-care workers in the early days of COVID-19 has been linked to deaths in long-term care homes. Even before COVID, nearly a quarter of our health care workers were immigrants. Thousands of others trained abroad are here, want to work in their chosen professions, but can’t get their credentials recognized here in a timely and affordable manner. While not addressing the health care sector specifically, Royal Bank economist Cynthia Leach haspredictedthat labour shortages are only going to get worse in 2022 because “pandemic-delayed retirements have created a potential wave of workforce exits and immigration levels have still not recovered.” Canada must tap its rich and underutilized supply of human capital, including immigrants who are “underemployed relative to their credentials,” women and Indigenous people. “In every crisis, it builds to the point where the dam bursts. Hopefully this is it,” said Terry Lake, CEO of the B.C. Care Providers Association. Until the pandemic, he acknowledged, no governments — including the B.C. Liberal government in which he served as health minister from 2013 to 2017 — has done enough to simplify a balkanized, complex and overly bureaucratic system. Something else always seemed more important, he said. Since taking on the CEO job in 2020, Terry Lake has spent most of his time meeting with federal ministers of health, immigration and human resource development, the provincial government and the regulators, urging them to speed up the assessment of health care workers’ credentials. Yet policy-makers have remained largely intransigent, choosing instead to try to lure people out of retirement. It’s worked to some extent. TheCanadian Institute for Health Informationsays 6,000 health care workers re-entered the workforce in 2020, including 4,186 registered nurses and 1,430 licensed practical nurses. The B.C. College of Nurses and Midwives added 2,025 nurses under its temporary emergency registration. All were non-practising registered psychiatric nurses, licensed practical nurses registered in other provinces or working for the Canadian Armed Forces and retired B.C. nurses. Internationally educated nurses were not allowed to apply. That said, the College has started streamlining credential assessments. By simplifying its language proficiency assessments last summer, it said that led to applications for registration from internationally educated nurses doubling to 800. And while the College’s website seemed to indicate that internationally nurses are not eligible for a supervised practice experience as a pathway to qualification, it has been quietly working with individual employers on a pilot project that’s resulted in 630 of the internationally nurses having qualified with another 420 close to the finish line. A clarification was added to the website Friday that says internationally educated nurses who do not meet the practice experience criteria but want to pursue the supervised experience as an alternative to transitional coursework should contact the College. Of course, for the program to work, nurses must be diverted from other essential work to do the supervision. Given the dire shortages, Lake said many employers can’t afford to add to the burdens of already overworked and burnt-out nurses. He’s more optimistic about the College’s plan for a ‘triple track assessment’ that starting in April will allow internationally educated nurses to have a single competency assessment to determine whether they are qualified to work as registered nurses, licensed practical nurses or health care aides. Currently, if registered nurses fail the competency assessment, they would have to apply separately for the others. But with the triple track, they might immediately be qualified as licensed practical nurses or aides with the opportunity to work toward later certification as registered nurses. Still, it’s slow slogging. At almost every meeting Lake has attended, someone asks him how many nurses and practical nurses are needed for care homes alone and by when. “I tell them, ‘We need a shitload,’” he said. “’We need lots. And we need them now.’” But Canada faces increasingly stiff competition for internationally educated nurses. One in every eight nurses in the world is already practising in a country other than where they were born or trained, according to the World Health Organization. The global shortage of nurses in 2018 was 5.8 million. By 2030, even if the number of nursing graduates increases by eight per cent annually to 36 million worldwide, the WHO says the shortfall will still be 5.7 million. Canada’s immigration policies favour health care workers. Their applications are expedited under the skilled workers program. And, the live-in caregivers program offers a faster route to permanent residency and it’s a path taken by the majority of Filipino nurses who account for nearly a third of the internationally educated nurses working here. But then the process stalls. Less than half of the foreign trained health-care workers end up working in their chosen professions. Most give up when their qualifications aren’t recognized in a timely manner. Others simply go somewhere else. This needs to be fixed and fast. Because if it isn’t, the pandemic shortages that have led to postponed surgeries, closed emergency rooms and unacceptable conditions in care homes won’t be unusual. They will be Canada’s new normal. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter:@bramham_daphne"
7,"Jan 12, 2022","Like so many things related to the pandemic, had politicians heeded experts’ warnings, they could have mitigated the critical nursing shortage that every province and territory now faces. In 2007, the Canadian Nurses Association, along with the Conference Board of Canada, predicted a dramatic shortfall in the number of health-care workers by 2022. That diagnosis was based on projections of rapidly increasing demand not only from a growing population, but an aging one that would require more health services. And within that aging demographic were a large number of nurses, physicians and other health-care professionals. Since then, COVID has resulted in burnout. There are now restrictions on part-timers working at more than one location. And some nurses and other professionals have left because of vaccine mandates. By mid-2021, Statistics Canadareported108,800 unfilled jobs in health care and social services. Of those, 22,400 were for registered nurses and psychiatric nurses. In response to the crisis, Ontario announced Tuesday that it is working with the College of Nurses of Ontario to get as many internationally educated nurses (IENs) as possible working within weeks in hospitals, long-term care homes and other facilities under the supervision of other registered and qualified health-care providers. So far, 1,200 have expressed interest. The B.C. Nurses’ Union described the situation here as “dire” even before COVID’s fourth wave and the arrival of Omicron. It also warned that nearly a third of its members expect to leave the profession by 2024. But when asked Tuesday about the severe nursing shortage particularly in the North, B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix offered no solutions, only empathy. The nursing crisis mirrors a decades-long physician shortage that leaves an estimated five million Canadians (including nearly 900,000 British Columbians) without family doctors, and various provinces unable to meet their own benchmarks for surgery wait times. Aside from nursing recruitment drives in the Philippines, the Caribbean and Central Africa, where a majority of IENs come from, a partial solution has stared policymakers in the face for decades. The solution? Streamline, simplify and make it cheaper for those who are already here to obtain licences to practice. Nurses need to pass language tests as well as three oral and written skills exams. It all takes time and money. By the B.C. Care Providers Association’s estimate, it can take as many as three years and as much as $20,000 for foreign-trained nurses — including Canadians who studied abroad — to clear all the hurdles. It is one reason why only 48 per cent of immigrants who intend to work as nurses end up doing so. According to Statistics Canada’s May 2021reportprofiling immigrant nurses, ofthe immigrants who arrived with bachelor’s degrees or higher, only 37 per got jobs as nurses. The 2015-16 data shows instead that nearly a quarter ended up in lower-paid work as licensed practical nurses, aides or orderlies. “Credentialing” has been acknowledged by both federal Conservative and Liberal governments as a problem, and they committed to fix it. The federal, provincial and territorial governments agreed in 2009 to the grandiosely named “Pan-Canadian Framework for the Assessment and Recognition of Foreign Qualifications.” Five years later, all 13 governments renewed their commitment to “advance our common goal that newcomers gain timely licensure and meaningful employment across Canada.” They all signed on to the deceptively named “Action Plan for Better Recognition of Foreign Qualifications”. Nothing has changed. In fairness to Ottawa, there is little it can do other than sprinkle some money around to try to help immigrants find work. Last fall, it announced a $15-million “foreign credential recognition program” to “scale up and expand existing supports with a focus on in-demand sectors, such as health, information technology and the skilled trades.” But what the physicians’ alternate pathways program offers are jobs that immigrants are either over-qualified for or occupations that require up to five years of retraining. The credentialing problem is baked into the Constitution, which gives provinces and territories control over health and education. Taking full advantage of their powers, each has different standards and processes for determining whether foreign qualifications align in health care and dozens of other professions and trades. With a startling one in five Canadian jobs regulated in some manner, the logjams in health care are only the most obvious. There are “nearly 500 regulatory bodies,” “at least five recognized credential assessment agencies” and “numerous” professional associations, nearly 300 “accredited post-secondary and vocational institutions,” according to a 2020 background paper on recognizing foreign credentials done for Parliament. Further frustrating the “fair and efficient recognition of foreign qualifications,” are “the practices of professional groups that have difficulty accepting immigration without Canadian education or retraining.” Author and researcher Laurence Brosseau reached a rather dismal conclusion. Because of jurisdictional complexities, “it makes it difficult to improve current procedures.” Yet, even within provinces and territories, it’s a dog’s breakfast. When foreign-trained doctors went to B.C. Supreme Court in 2018 to challenge the constitutionality of applying different licensing rules to them versus Canadian medical school graduates, the judge stayed the case until it was determined who actually sets the rules. Three years later, the B.C. Health Professionals Review Board has yet to decide. For nurses, recognition of credentials isn’t as complicated. Still, it’s time-consuming and expensive enough that it’s one reason Stats Can says fewer than half of those with bachelor of nursing degrees or higher aren’t working in their chosen profession. Employment Canada reports that more than 25,000 internationally educated nurses came here in the last decade and are working. That’s great. They’re sorely needed. But the flipside is that there are potentially another 25,000 whose skills, training and potential is being wasted. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne • Immigrants, who arrived in Canada as adults, comprise 22 per cent of the health-care workforce, according to a May 2021 Statistics Canada report profiling immigrant nurses. • Nearly one in every eight adult immigrants from the Caribbean, Bermuda, West and Central Africa is a nurse. • Nurses from the Philippines account for nearly a third of all immigrant nurses, with the majority coming as economic immigrants under caregiver programs offering a pathway to permanent residency. • Of those who came with the intention of working as nurses, only 48 per cent ended up doing that.

8,"Jan 09, 2022","VICTORIA — Janet Leffek turns 88 today (Jan. 9), and all her husband wants is to be by her side — but pandemic visitor restrictions will deny the couple of 63 years that dignity. “I’m not allowed to visit her on her birthday (and) it cuts me to the heart,” said Ken Leffek, 87. Janet, no longer able to stand or walk independently, was admitted to Broadmead Care’s Veterans Memorial Lodge in Saanich with dementia in July. Ken visited her on 163 of the next 164 days, missing only Remembrance Day. For two hours each day, Ken attended to Janet’s needs, read the daily paper with her and “brought her back to reality” with old photos and stories. Caring staff encouraged all this, he said. Those visits stopped on Jan. 1, when COVID-19 restrictions, driven by surging daily cases of the Omicron variant, began. The restrictions allow each resident just one “essential visitor” — a designation made on a case-by-case basis by care facility administrators based on provincial criteria that includes visits for end of life and visits paramount to the resident’s physical care and mental well-being. That can include assistance with feeding, mobility, personal care or communication. Ken, a retired Dalhousie University professor and dean, said his request was denied based on the fact his wife can feed herself. “If she needs to wipe her nose, someone has to hand her a Kleenex,” he said. “When her wheelchair is left in the middle of her room, as it always is, she cannot move it even two feet to reach the call button, and if she could reach it, she does not understand that she must press the red button to summon a care worker. “However, because she can move her forearms and get food into her mouth, that disqualifies her from having me as an essential visitor,” he continued. “An 88-year old physically and mentally infirm person should have, as a fundamental human right, access every day to her husband of more than 63 years.” Geriatrician Roger Wong said this is exactly the kind of situation prompting him to speak out against the restrictions. “To families and loved ones such as Ken, it is not just frustrating — it’s heartbreaking to be told he is not essential,” said Wong, a clinical professor in the faculty of medicine at the University of British Columbia. While older adults in seniors homes have been among hardest hit by COVID, Wong said it is short-sighted to apply the same restrictions now as early in the pandemic. “We have a lot more tools.” And while Canadians 65 and older accounted for about 80 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths in 2020, the statistics don’t capture the “potential damage and devastating effects” of social isolation and loneliness, he said. In his view, the order on visitor restrictions in long-term care should be “reversed” and visits should be recognized for both their physical and mental benefit and as a “basic human right.” The restrictions are meant to be a temporary measure until rapid tests from the federal government arrive and a process for testing all visitors can be set up by each care home, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said this past week. At that time, each resident will be automatically approved for a designated “social visitor,” she said. Wong says it’s problematic for individual care homes to hand out these rights and sees a further problem in distinguishing between “essential” and “social” visitors. “Who gets to decide what is essential and what is social to this person, to every senior in long-term care?” Seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie has said her office is hearing from spouses and families being told they can’t visit even though they assist their loved one in a variety of ways. Mackenzie wants the province “to declare that every resident in long term care is entitled to designate at least one person as their essential visitor.” A November 2020 review by her office showed 52 per cent of essential visitor requests were denied. Only about 25 per cent of long-term care residents have a designated “essential visitor.” At Broadmead Care in Saanich, 69 requests were made over seven days, and 19 were approved, said president and CEO Derrick Bernardo. The facility has 225 residents. Bernardo said essential visitor status is given “if a resident’s care needs cannot be met by a staff member” and that resident requires a family member or a close friend provide the care. Decisions are made following strict criteria, he said, and an appeals process is open to anyone who is denied. On Saturday, Ken recalled how he met Janet in 1956 during a “Saturday night dance” at University College, University of London, where he was studying. As they danced, they talked — he had a plan to go to Canada and she was from Canada and planned to return. “That immediately started off our relationship.” The couple, who have two adult children, moved to Victoria in 1996. Last month, as Christmas drew near, Janet became confused and thought each day was Christmas. Ken would, with love, set her straight. He brought her the paper each day — she can still read and sometimes even do the crossword — as a way to help keep her mind active. Today, however, Ken will have to wish his wife happy birthday through Broadmead Care’s messaging system, sending a scanned version of a birthday card. It was too difficult for him to talk much about the impact of the restrictions and missing Janet’s birthday — he said he gets too emotional. Even when he could visit, the stays seemed so short to Janet that she’d tell him: “Our marriage has finished; we’re not together anymore.” It’s hard on Ken to repeat this. “But I tell her we can be together two hours every day and that’s better than nothing.” ceharnett@timescolonist.com Read more stories from the Times Colonist here."
9,"Dec 31, 2021","Rows of rooms line a long, narrow hallway where a tall aluminum cart stacked with food trays is parked as staff at the front desk register visitors and offer surgical masks. At the other end, a large TV from the 1980s is being removed from the building, which could itself be replaced if a rezoning plan is approved. The nearly 60-year-old Inglewood Care Centre, home to 230 residents, would be bulldozed, along with its hospital-like setting, as part of a “household of 12” model of private rooms based on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. Chris Russell, administrator of the home, said between 43 and 51 people live on each floor of the centre. But a rezoning application expected to go before the District of West Vancouver in April calls for a pair of buildings to accommodate two units, or households, of a dozen residents per floor. “The big thing is you won’t have that large group dynamic,” he said, passing a dining room, the type that would no longer exist as a mass gathering place in the new home where members of the same household would eat meals together. Baptist Housing, a non-profit provider of seniors housing with 21 homes around B.C., bought Inglewood in February 2020 with an aim to redevelop it in line with trends toward fewer residents per unit. However, the pandemic forced the organization to reduce the number of people in each household from 23 to 12 in order toslash the incidence of COVID-19 or other infectious illnesseslike seasonal influenza in keeping with guidelines set by health authorities in B.C. The Health Ministry said design guidelines call for 12 to 18 people per unit, with a washroom in each person’s living space. Operators of owned and contracted homes may accommodate two people in a room for fewer than five per cent of residents if there’s a plan to transfer them to separate rooms on request. Inglewood largely escaped the ravages of the pandemic and had no deaths. Over 15,000 people have died during the pandemic in care homes across the country, the highest proportion among all 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Marc Kinna, CEO of Baptist Housing, said Inglewood’s expansion would include some independent and supportive housing options for seniors, along with affordable accommodation for staff, the vast majority of whom commute from outside the West Vancouver area. The new buildings would incorporate aspects of the so-called Green House model in the United States, where a homelike environment for a lower number of residents does away with large, institutional-type facilities. “The value of a household of 12 isn’t new. What’s new is that places that employed a household of 12 model had much less spread of COVID-19 than places that had communities of 20, 30, 40 residents sharing a space,” Kinna said. “Not only did it have socialization benefits and the quality-of-life benefits to go through a pandemic, you also realized that it has extreme value in terms of saving people’s lives and providing for better protection against COVID or other diseases that might be yet to come.” As part of the proposal, families could safely access Inglewood during an outbreak by taking an elevator to a loved one’s floor, where avisitation room with a Plexiglas wallwould help reduce the risk of infection. A separate entrance and exit for staff and a room for putting on and removing personal protective equipment is also part of the 12-person model, which Kinna said won’t be any more expensive for residents, who pay about 80 per cent of their annual income for long-term care. Baptist Housing would negotiate a new agreement with Vancouver Coastal Health to help pay for the increased cost of the new building. The budget for the entire project is estimated at $583 million, with an expected contribution of about $15.5 million from B.C. Housing and $13 million from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. Pat Armstrong, a distinguished professor emeritus of sociology at York University in Toronto, joined international teams to tour long-term homes in Norway, Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada between 2016 and 2018. Their one-week visits to at least two homes in each country were part of a 10-year study that was completed in 2020. “The Swedish and Norwegian people were especially shocked to see our big units,” Armstrong said of researchers from countries where eight to 12 seniors typically live in a long-term care unit, compared with B.C. and Ontario, for example, where up to 32 people are housed together in most homes. There are no Green House models in Canada, but some aspects have been implemented in parts of the country, including at one known as Eden Home in Halifax and another dubbed the Butterfly Home in Ontario’s Peel Region, she said. Consistency in staffing is a major benefit for both staff and residents in the smaller homes where employees are offered full-time jobs while many of their counterparts elsewhere have part-time hours and work at multiple locations. Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto, said that besides appropriate staffing, smaller living quarters need adequate government funding, beyond the traditional formula for the current, higher number of residents per unit. The pandemic has shown that the Green House approach led to a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 transmission, that staff felt better supported and family involvement was valued, he said. “They tend to deliver superior care, pandemic or no pandemic,” said Sinha, who is also director of health policy research at the National Institute on Ageing at Ryerson University in Toronto. He said that with baby boomers turning 85 within a decade, Canada will face an unprecedented demand for long-term care, so the work to reshape the system can’t wait. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised to establish national long-term care standards and Armstrong, who is on a committee to develop them, said public consultations were expected to begin early next year. “All provinces, territories and the federal government must work together and say, ‘Enough is enough, that this was so deeply horrific that we can never let this happen again,”‘ Sinha said of the number of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care homes. “While some incremental things have happened, I really am hoping that ultimately, given the fact that out of respect to the 15,000-plus Canadians who died, we will try to honour their legacy by getting it right for those who are left behind and for those who one day might actually need to be living in a long-term care home.” Get the latest COVID-19 news delivered to your inbox weeknights at 7 p.m. by subscribing toour newsletter here.

10,"Feb 12, 2022","The main route to the Pacific Highway border crossing in Surrey was closed Saturday afternoon after protesters opposed to vaccine mandates and other COVID-19 measures broke through RCMP barricades and began driving the wrong way down 176th Street. The RCMP says in a press release that the “behaviour is not being tolerated” and is being investigated. No arrests were made. There were no reported injuries, but the Surrey RCMP says the drivers could have caused harm to pedestrians and first responders. Cpl. Vanessa Munn, a spokeswoman for the Surrey RCMP, confirmed Saturday afternoon that officers continue to monitor the situation. She said motorists should expect significant traffic congestion in the area of 176th Street and 8th Avenue and are cautioned to avoid the area. 176th Street is now closed from 8th Avenue southbound. “Our priority remains keeping the peace and ensuring public safety,” Munn said. Border crossing photos show hundreds of drivers and their supporters lining the street, part of what organizers called the third Lower Mainland Freedom Convoy, which travelled from Chilliwack to the 176th Street crossing in Surrey. Chris Rasmussen said he came to the rally to support freedom of choice. “When the government mandates your decisions about your health, they’ve crossed a line,” Rasmussen said. “I’ve lost $400,000 in revenue in my companies — they’re done. Let’s get on with living.” A woman named Crystal, who didn’t want to give her last name, said the Mounties shouldn’t be blocking the convoy. “We’ve been waiting hours and hours to see the convoy,” she said, adding that the RCMP’s blockade has had the same effect as the convoy: “At the end of the day, the border’s still blocked.” Drumming, dance music and flags filled the air at the corner of the streets. “Freedom” was periodically chanted, led by a woman with a bullhorn standing on the roof of a pickup as families with small children milled around. Chalk messages scrawled on the pavement read “freedom rules” and “media is the virus.” Another woman named Kim said: “We want to make sure that our voices are heard. We want the mandates to be dropped. We want (Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau to step down from office — we want our freedoms back.” A long line of transport trucks and other vehicles stretched down 8th Avenue on either side of the intersection. The Surrey Board of Trade and the Surrey Chamber of Commerce both issued statements speaking out against the protesters’ actions. “The impact of these blockades is choking already impacted supply chains, businesses and jobs,” the Board of Trade said in a statement. “This is an unacceptable sabotage of the economy.” The Chamber of Commerce called for more action by governing bodies and said COVID-19 and extreme weather caused labour shortages and supply chain disruptions, and the protests are adding to the strain and preventing economic recovery. “Allowing these illegal closures to continue will also have serious economic and reputational consequences for the years ahead,” it said. #BCHwy15- CLOSED SOUTHBOUND south of 8 Ave due to a public demonstration.

11,"Feb 09, 2022","Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says her gatherings and events public health order could be lifted when it expires next week. “What you will hear next week will be the details of how we are going to be moving forward,” said Henry. “The gatherings and events orders are coming up for review on (Feb.) 16th, and we’ll be putting out in detail on the 15th what we’re doing for the next few weeks. “You will hear less about the pandemic as we get through this wave, and more about how we can continue to manage our personal risks as restrictions are adjusted in step with what we are seeing, in terms of transmission and hospitalizations.” There are four active public health orders set up to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the community. The gatherings and events order is the only one with an expiry date. The other orders — with no expiry date — are the face coverings order, food and liquor serving premises order and the residential care COVID preventive measures order. The gatherings and events order governs indoor and outdoor personal gatherings, indoor and outdoor organized gatherings, indoor events at venues and gatherings in casinos, places of worship and workplaces. It also covers fitness and exercise activities, sports activities and aquatic centres. Under the order indoor personal gatherings aren’t allowed if anyone in the group is not a fully vaccinated adult and the gathering must be limited to the family group, plus a maximum of 10 guests. Wedding and funeral receptions are banned. Indoor events at venues — like Canucks games, concerts or theatre — are allowed at 50 per cent capacity, and casinos can operate at 50 per cent seated capacity. For churches, capacity is capped at 50 per cent if any of the congregation are unvaccinated. Dancing in any indoor public setting is banned, unless you’re in a dance class. The heaviest restriction in the food and liquor serving premises order is that any pub, bar or nightclub that doesn’t sell prepared meals can’t open.On Wednesday, Henry said this order would be amended to allow those businesses to offer catered food. She said the government’s COVID daily surveillance report would also be changed — including dropping the active cases statistic. This is because daily case counts are no longer accurate because of the government’s limited testing policy. As a result, the active case count is also inaccurate. On Tuesday, health authorities PCR-tested only 9,275 people. There are 893 people in hospital either because of, or with COVID, of which 143 are being treated in intensive care. Eighteen people died because of COVID on Tuesday. dcarrigg@postmedia.com Get the latest COVID-19 news delivered to your inbox weeknights at 7 p.m. by subscribing to our newsletterhere.

12,,"Before the pandemic, Becky didn’t expect to bring her dog to the office. But lockdown changed her view. While it allowed Becky (not her real name) to see “the tremendous mental health benefits” of having a pet around while working, the surge in pandemic puppies also increased competition for canine daycare: returning to the office without her dog could now cost her thousands of pounds a year. However Becky’s employer, a financial services company, recently moved to London premises where the landlord does not allow four-legged friends. “None of the executives involved in the move have dogs. It doesn’t seem like my company tried to negotiate a change in policy.” She is now reviewing her options. “In my next job I will consider [the ability to bring a dog to work] quite a key feature,” she says. “It signifies the culture of the company.” Bringing your dog to work is not an entirely new habit: Sigmund Freud noted that his patients were more at ease when his chow chow Jofi came to sessions. But it has been fanned by two trends: people’s growing attachment to their pets, including their unwillingness to leave dogs at home alone all day; and younger employees’ belief that work should not just provide a paycheque, but also reflect their broader identity. Google’s code of conduct states that “affection for our canine friends is an integral facet of our corporate culture.” In Britain, dogs now appear in hospitals, school common rooms, barristers’ chambers and startups. Will Smith, co-founder of ethical debit card Tred, takes his lockdown puppy — a golden retriever called Mayo — into the office three days a week. “I didn’t buy a dog so someone else could look after her,” he says. Yet many large employers — including Deloitte, PwC and HSBC — have blanket no-dog policies. JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive Jamie Dimon welcomed customers’ dogs into its Chase bank branches, but not employees’ dogs into headquarters. Often there is an assumption that canine colleagues will disrupt the focus or formality of the workplace, or bark in client meetings. Managers wonder how to combine dogs with open-plan offices, and with employees who are allergic, fearful or have religious objections. In the move to attract workers back to the office, these policies are coming under strain and companies need ways of accommodating both dog-lovers and non-dog-lovers. Pre-pandemic, about 45 dogs were brought to the Vermont headquarters of ice-cream-maker Ben & Jerry’s every day — that is about one for every two workers — says Lindsay Bumps, a marketing employee, who sits on the company’s canine culture committee. “If you’re not dog-friendly, you’re missing out on a huge opportunity to further engage your employees and this unique cultural experience, as well as a little bit of stress reduction,” she says. Dogs at Ben & Jerry’s are mostly kept in workers’ offices and cubicles (guarded by baby-gates); they are not allowed in most communal areas. The company operates something akin to a three-strikes-and-you’re-out policy for canine misbehaviour, which reduces to one strike for showing aggression. But Bumps says that, in her nine years there, only one or two dogs have failed to adapt to the office. At Tred, Smith believes there are benefits to having a dog in the office. “You become more human in conversation,” he notes, and more memorable to external contacts. Nestlé, which owns the Purina pet food brand, says that, since allowing dogs into its U.K headquarters in 2015, “the positive effects on our culture and the office atmosphere have been huge.” Studies elsewhere have linked dogs to increased collaboration. There is, however, little research on the potential downsides of dog ownership, says Joni Delanoeije, a researcher at KU Leuven, a university in Belgium. These include causing distractions and disputes between co-workers. I actually had a colleague ask if she could bring a miniature pony in. I was like, absolutely! Indeed, an estimated 10 to 20 per cent of people worldwide are allergic to dogs or cats. Often co-workers’ concerns can be overcome with small adjustments. Oli Malmed, who takes a sprocker spaniel into the London office of compliance automator PassFort, says he has contended with barking, disruption and a couple of colleagues who are allergic. “If we spot those people, we have to go into a separate cubicle and that’s us for the day.” Nonetheless, having his dog at work is “a delight,” he says. “It’s been quite a miserable couple of years, and leniency around this does lead to satisfaction.” But having dogs in the office does not always end well. One canine regularly stole shoes from beneath employees’ desks; his owner had to send out an email at the end of the day to reunite co-workers with their footwear. Another worker left her job, frustrated at the colleague’s dog who sniffed between her legs throughout working hours. Even dog-lovers can find it challenging. Henry Sands, managing director of political consultancy Sabi Strategy, took his 32kg Labrador and 15kg spaniel into the office regularly, where they jumped up on unsuspecting workers. “It was a nightmare. You’re having to apologize for everything.” He now avoids taking his dogs in, and is skeptical that managers should need dogs to improve workplace morale: “It’s a cop-out,” he says. In fact, after noticing that one employee was bringing in different dogs, he eventually worked out that she was moonlighting as a dog-sitter. From a dog’s point of view, being in an office is probably more pleasant than being left at home. Battersea Dogs & Cats Home recommends that dogs are left alone for no longer than four hours. Others argue that it depends on the individual dog, but that most welcome company. “We’ve bred dogs for generations and generations to want to be around humans,” says Heather Bacon, a veterinary clinical senior lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire. Managers may worry about disruption, but “dogs should be sleeping for around 15 to 18 hours a day. They don’t need to be stimulated all the time,” she says. Yet not all dogs enjoy the office environment, let alone the commute. Some puppies missed out on socialization during the pandemic, and may find it difficult to adapt to the office. For those companies at present resistant to allowing dogs in, change may come from the top-down. “Very often it starts with the boss bringing the dog,” says Delanoeije. “He or she makes the rules, and if he or she decides to bring a dog, people have to adapt.” British Land and Landsec, two of the U.K.’s biggest commercial landlords, both told the FT that they were happy to discuss pets in their buildings. One of British Land’s new developments in Paddington has “a dedicated dog access corridor,” while Landsec’s office in Victoria offers its employees a puppy therapy service. Some companies, particularly on the west coast of the U.S., offer benefits to pet owners, including adoption or bereavement leave. Skeptics may wonder, after employees brought their political opinions and their dogs to the office, what they will bring next. “People ask about cats,” says Bumps of Ben & Jerry’s. “I actually had a colleague ask if she could bring a miniature pony in. I was like, absolutely! My CEO thought differently about that at the time.” © 2022 The Financial Times Ltd. _____________________________________________________________ For more stories about the future of work,sign up forthe FP Work newsletter. ______________________________________________________________"

COVID-19 Symptom Self-Assessment Tool Health officials reported 17 deaths from COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the number of deaths in B.C. to 2,747. The bulk of the deaths occurred in Fraser Health, where nine people died from the disease over the last 24-hour reporting period. Interior Health and Island Health had three deaths each, while Vancouver Coastal Health had two fatalities. Hospitalizations dipped slightly to 846, down 21 from Thursday. Out of these 136 are in intensive care. These figures include people who are admitted to hospital because of COVID-19 and those who have incidental cases. The federal government will announce changes to pandemic measures at Canada’s borders next week, Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos signalled Friday, while Canada’s chief public health officer said the country is looking to more sustainable plans to manage COVID-19. “With the worst of Omicron now behind us, our government is actively reviewing the measures in place at our borders and we should be able to communicate changes on this next week,” Duclos told reporters. On Friday, CBC News reported the government is close to removing mandatory PCR COVID testing for Canadians who are fully vaccinated and who travel outside the country. Currently, the government advises against all non-essential international travel. Anyone travelling within Canada by plane, passenger train or boat must be vaccinated against COVID-19, and international travellers are subject to COVID-19 test requirements. Duclos said during a news briefing the worst of the latest wave of the pandemic is now behind Canada, and the government will “continue to tweak,” measures accordingly.

14,,"VICTORIA — Hundreds of protesters gathered on the sidewalks around the legislature and Inner Harbour on Saturday and vehicles of every description clogged the streets and blared their horns calling governments to end vaccine mandates. For the third weekend in a row, areas around the B.C. legislature swelled with protesters and heavy traffic in support of the truckers’ convoy that continues to occupy Downtown Ottawa as well as several border crossings. “We want our freedom!” yelled one trucker as he laid on his horn. Commercial trucks — some showing their affiliations, others not — poured into the area and kept circling the blocks as a platoon of Victoria police motorcycle officers kept vehicles trying to pull over to keep moving. Pickups, cars, vans, bikers — even long motorhomes — all festooned in Canadian flags and plastered with signs and paint started long parades, blowing their vehicle horns or using hand-held air horns that could be heard for kilometres around. The vehicles were also prominent on Douglas Street, with some pedestrians running out to shake hands. Other protesters were greeted with “get a brain” and “you’re idiots.” Parking lots around the legislature were quickly filling by noon. Carloads of people unloaded and attached flags to hockey sticks. It was a diverse crowd — from Birkenstocks to biker boots and everything in between — and the growing ranks on the legislature lawn showed middle-aged couples, parents with their children, burly bikers, young adults and teens. No masks were being worn. “We are the fringe,” said one young man. “and we want our freedoms back.” Another said: “The people who are getting vaccinated are getting COVID-19 more that the non-vaccinated.” Protesters were echoing their counterparts in Ottawa, saying they want an endgame plan from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government on restrictions surrounding the pandemic. Victoria police were warning motorists Saturday afternoon that heavy traffic was causing delays around the legislature and up Douglas Street. Police said no roads were closed by them or blocked by protesters. VicPD said in a statement Saturday that last weekend’s protest resulted in two arrests “so far,” including one man arrested for extensive vandalism on vehicles. “Remember that safe, peaceful and lawful protest are protected under the Charter,” the statement said. “Dangerous and/or unlawful acts during protests will be met with de-escalation and enforcement.” One bystander in a mask said Saturday: “I live here and I just wanted to come and see it myself … it’s like Canada Day down here.” More news, fewer ads, faster load time:Get unlimited, ad-lite access to the Vancouver Sun, the Province, National Post and 13 other Canadian news sites for just $14/month or $140/year.

15,"Dec 19, 2021","A diagnostic test to identify Alzheimer’s disease is available for the first time in Canada, thanks in part to work done by researchers at UBC’s Faculty of Medicine. In a prepared statement, principal investigator Dr. Mari DeMarco — a clinical associate professor at UBC’s Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and clinical chemist at Providence Health Care — said the test measured proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. DeMarco said that in Alzheimer’s disease, the proteins amyloid-beta and tau clump together in the brain to form “amyloid plaques and tau tangles,” respectively. “As it is not possible to see these clumps using regular imaging techniques, the new test measures protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, using them as biomarkers that help determine if a person’s declining brain health is likely due to Alzheimer’s disease,” she said. More than 500,000 Canadians are living with Alzheimer’s disease or a related form of dementia and that number is projected to double by 2031 due to an ageing population. “This is an urgent and rapidly growing health-care issue,” said DeMarco, adding the test could assist with earlier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease, giving patients and their families more time to plan and more timely access to health care and community services. The UBC researchers were part of aCanada-wide teamand developed a key component of the biomarker test. The test must be ordered by doctors specializing in dementia care, who can recommend it for people with mild to moderate symptoms that are suspected to caused by Alzheimer’s disease. As part of the study, patients were also able to provide their perspective on how the test results impacted their lives. “Our aim is to gain a better understanding of how this testing impacts personal and medical decision making, and health care costs. We want to inform positive change in the Canadian health care system and improve care and support for individuals living with Alzheimer’s disease and their families,” said Dr. DeMarco. dcarrigg@postmedia.com"
16,"Nov 11, 2021","Confusion among some seniors over the implementation of B.C.’s vaccination card could have been addressed by consultation before implementation, according to thefindings of a community study. Researchers are describingthe experience of seniors with the vaccine card as an example of the digital divide — the gap between a society where information is increasingly digital and the inability of some people to access what they need. For seniors, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic has moved many government functions online, such as applying for monthly Old Age Security. “It would be a good idea for decision makers to involve seniors and community-based organizations and invite them to the table when decision-making is happening,” said Hannah Shin, a community-based researcher. “We need to ensure that everyone has accessible information in multiple modes of communication strategies. We just assume that everyone gets their news through social media. That’s just not the case.” Therapid evaluation projectwas undertaken by Simon Fraser University’sScience and Technology for Aging Researching (STAR) Instituteand411 Seniors Care Centre Society. Program staff and volunteers at 411 connected with 514 seniors about whether they had received their vaccination passport. If they had a smartphone, for example, they helped to ensure it had the correct QR code. Other information gathering included focus group discussions and an anonymous survey. Shin said while the study sample was a small one, she thinks it is representative of the challenges seniors faced with vaccination records. She said they heard many of the same stories repeatedly, such as seniors asking a friend or a relative to help and referring people to 411. “There are some older adults who are very tech savvy and do want to engage with technology,” she said. “There is also another group that maybe don’t have the means to engage with digital technology. Sometimes they don’t want to participate.” Shin said some seniors wondered why the provincial government didn’t communicate about the vaccination passport by regular mail. As well, seniors felt information about the documents should have been clearer with less jargon. Those without smartphones wondered why the province didn’t issue a laminated card similar to the CareCard. “There is a definitely a lack of digital literacy with older adults,” Shin said. “COVID has exacerbated that.” The majority of seniors who use and go to 411 are low-income. Of the 948,062 seniors in B.C. as of 2019, according to theSeniors Advocate,274,000 are low income and receive the Guaranteed Income Supplement. Andrew Sixsmith, a professor at SFU and director of the STAR Institute, said confusion and anxiety among some seniors over the vaccination passport is part of a larger issue of what it means to live in a digital age. “We really need to understand that and it’s implications,” he said. “The bigger picture is this whole issue of living in a digital world where technology is so important to us. We need to understand how that works in society and collaborate with organizations who are dealing with the most vulnerable people.” Organizations where seniors can go for help navigating the digital world include: 411 Seniors Centre: #330 – 333 Terminal Avenue, Vancouver, 604-684-8171.

17,"Nov 07, 2021","Experts on post-traumatic stress disorders, mental health and rehabilitation will run a centre dedicated to treating veterans and first responders at a unique Surrey condo development that is on track for completing its first phase late next year. The Royal Canadian Legion B.C./Yukon Command, Whalley Legion Branch 229 and the Lark Group have construction underway at the Legion Veterans Village (LVV) in downtown Surrey. They recently said the market housing portion of the development, marketed as Parc Centrale, with 171 one- and two-bedroom units, sold out. Phase 1 of the LVV building will include a Centre of Clinical Excellence for PTSD and Mental Health and an Innovation Centre for Rehabilitation. There will be programs and services focused on clinical rehabilitation services, health care programs, services and trauma counselling for PTSD and mental health. There will also be a focus on training and research toward new practices, interventions and technologies involving robotics and advancements in neuroscience. It will also house a new facility for the Whalley Legion Branch 229. The centres will be led by names including Ryan D’Arcy, a neuroscientist and researcher and professor at Simon Fraser University, who holds the Surrey Memorial Hospital Foundation B.C. Leadership Chair in Multimodal Technology for Healthcare Innovations. Others include: Venu Karapareddy, a psychiatrist and founder/director of Actum Health, who specializes in PTSD, mental health and addictions and is a University of B.C. clinical assistant professor; and, also Ashok Krishnamoorthy, a medical director and department head of psychiatry at Richmond Hospital. Debbie Greene will act as its operational director. She is an accountant and brain injury and veteran issues advocate who has been instrumental in the ongoing rehabilitation and recovery of her husband, Canadian war veteran Trevor Greene, who had a devastating brain injury acquired in Afghanistan. “We are getting closer every day to being able to serve our veteran community in our brand new facility,” said Tony Moore, President of the Whalley Legion Branch 229. “Hopefully by next November 2022, we’ll be able to hold our first Remembrance Day ceremony at the new Legion Veterans Village.”"
18,"Nov 02, 2021","Public health officials insist the program to give booster doses to seniors in care homes did not begin too late in B.C., despite a rise in the number of care homes reporting outbreaks. There are currently 34 outbreaks ofCOVID-19in B.C. care homes, with new outbreaks being added almost daily. Dr. Bonnie Henry, the provincial health officer, says the program was not implemented too late, despite B.C. lagging Ontario, Alberta and Saskatchewan by a month in starting booster shots. By mid-October, nearly all long-term care residents in Ontario had been provided a booster shot. “I don’t believe our booster program started too late. We waited for the data that showed what the optimal interval was (for booster doses)” Henry said. She said Monday the province began to experience outbreaks in care homes starting in the summer at facilities where second doses had recently been provided. Over the past month, public health has provided booster doses to almost all residents of care homes, as well as requiring workers and visitors show proof of vaccination. The optimal interval recommended by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization is that booster doses should be given to seniors six months after their second dose.  However, the committee’s recommendation was not provided until the end of September — long after some provinces went ahead with the shots — which might explain why seniors in B.C. who received their second doses early this year were not given boosters over the summer. The B.C. government has been criticized for waiting for the NACI recommendation rather than emulating other provinces. Terry Lake, the B.C. Care Providers Association CEO, said last month that faster booster shots could have prevented an outbreak in a Burnaby care home. “We’re heartsick because we’ve been asking the Ministry of Health authorities since the first of September about … boosters,” he said in mid-October, On Monday, Health Minister Adria Dix said B.C’s booster program, which began on Oct. 4, is almost complete. “The work is substantially done, with 93 per cent of seniors having received their booster dose. The program at care homes will be finished in the next few days,” he said. Henry said despite the outbreaks, the effectiveness of vaccines and infection control programs mean those outbreaks are less severe than during the first and second waves of the pandemic. “We are continuing to see mostly small outbreaks and that is important. As soon as we see a single case, we increase testing and monitoring and what that does lead to is identifying many people who have very mild symptoms or who may be asymptomatic,” she said. “And although we are seeing some breakthrough cases, especially among seniors who have been immunized early, it is mostly a milder illness if you are vaccinated.” “Breakthrough cases” is medical jargon for cases that happen in the fully vaccinated One of the longest outbreaks is at the Cottonwood long-term care home in Kelowna, which began on Aug 4.  More than 15 residents have died and more than 54 of the centre’s 221 residents have the virus. Henry said many residents at Cottonwoods had not received their second doses of vaccine when the outbreak started. She said there are a number of reasons why that outbreak has been so persistent. “There were a number of staff who were not vaccinated and there were people moved into the facility who were not vaccinated,” she explained.  “And, it has multi-bedded rooms, so it is one of the most challenging outbreaks.” The province has not said whether it has changed its policy to ensure anyone transferred to a care home has been fully vaccinated first. That shortfall was pointed out in a report on care home outbreaks by the B.C. seniors advocate that was released last month. Henry said she expects fewer outbreaks in care homes in the future. “We are hopeful that with the booster dose and as we take increased measures with visitors and health care workers that we will continue to see that come down, but it just reminds us that this virus can be vicious when it gets into those very high risk settings.” With files from Gord Hoekstra"
19,"Oct 31, 2021","The number ofCOVID-19outbreaks at care homes continues to rise in B.C. even as a booster shot program for residents that began to roll out earlier this month appears to be nearing completion. B.C. Ministry of Health officials would not say what percentage of residents at care homes had received a third, booster jab or provide any details of the rollout. But health ministry spokeswoman Aileen Machell said “we’re almost there” in a brief written response to questions that included when the province expected to complete its booster program at care homes. Machell said Health Minister Adrian Dix would provide details this week. According to the latest provincial and regional health authority information there are 28 outbreaks in long-term care, assisted-living and independent-living residences. That’s up from 16 long-term care and assisted living homes experiencing outbreaks two weeks ago, and well up from mid-July when outbreaks dropped to zero. The outbreaks include one at the Cottonwoods Care Centre in Kelowna that is now in its third month. There have been 17 deaths since Aug. 2 at the 221-bed facility, where residents received a booster jab by Oct. 11, according to Interior Health officials. In the second-most deadly ongoing outbreak, there have been 13 deaths since Sept. 27 at the Willingdon Care Centre in Burnaby where residents have also had boosters. An outbreak was also just declared Friday at the 60-bed Cascade Gardens Seniors Community in Burnaby, where residents have had their boosters, according to Fraser Health officials. The B.C. government took until the end of September to announce a third COVID-19 shot for vulnerable populations, including at long-term care homes, after the National Advisory Committee on Immunization finally endorsed a third shot to restore protection that may have waned over time. The province has since said that booster shots will be available to all British Columbians starting next year. “It’s a susceptible population (in long-term care homes), and all it takes is one exposure, even from a vaccinated person who would have gotten it from the pool of unvaccinated people that persists,” said Dr. Brian Conway, president and medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre. Conway stressed it was important to hustle with third doses in vulnerable population such as in care homes, but to also reach as many people who remain unvaccinated in the general population. Interior Health officials said they could not immediately comment about the reasons for the protracted outbreak at the Cottonwoods facility in Kelowna. But earlier, Interior Health’s medical health officer Dr. Silvina Mema told reporters that it has been difficult to prevent and stop the spread of COVID-19 at Cottonwoods because it was an older building, had shared rooms and a population of dementia patients. Only 34 beds are in private rooms, according to information from the B.C. senior’s advocate Information compiled by Postmedia from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control shows there have been outbreaks at nearly 70 care homes since the beginning of August, nearly half of which have seen one death or more for a total of more than 100 deaths. At those facilities, there have been more than 1000 cases, about two thirds of them in residents and the remainder among staff. As of Oct. 12, all staff working in long-term care homes had to be fully vaccinated and faced termination after two weeks unpaid leave for failing to do so. On Oct. 12, all visitors also had to show proof of vaccination to enter a care home. Several provinces approved booster shots for residents in long-term care homes far earlier than in B.C., including Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. Other jurisdictions, including in the U.S., had done the same. By mid-October, nearly all long-term care residents in Ontario had been provided a booster shot. ghoekstra@postmedia.com twitter.com/gordon_hoekstra Get the latest COVID-19 news delivered to your inbox weeknights at 7 p.m. by subscribing toour newsletter here."
20,"Oct 25, 2021","A company that operates five long-term care homes in B.C. expects to issue termination notices on Tuesday to five employees who have not been vaccinated for COVID-19, according to the CEO of H&H Total Care Services. Another five employees chose to resign in the two weeks since the province issued a health order requiring all workers at long-term care and assisted living homes to have at least one COVID vaccination by Oct. 26. The order was later expanded to include all workers in the acute care system, including hospitals, with a final deadline for vaccination two weeks later. H&H employs about 625 workers in its five B.C. homes, including the Hamlets at Duncan and the Hamlets at Westside in Kamloops, so the 10 workers represent less than one per cent of its workforce. “When the mandate first came out, we were pushing 20 per cent” or 125 workers, said CEO Hendrik Van Ryk. “We have had a significant improvement (in numbers vaccinated) in the last two weeks.” He said those who resisted vaccination and only agreed to get vaccinated in order to keep their jobs, “they’re not happy. … (But) they loved being in health care.” It will be difficult to replace the 10 employees who will be leaving because of an existing widespread health-care worker shortage. H&H may have to limit client admissions, said Van Ryk. Mike Klassen, spokesman for the B.C. Care Providers Association, wasn’t able to say Monday the extent to which termination notices were being issued at other care homes in B.C. But he acknowledged that homes were having difficulty with staffing levels. “This has been challenging for many of our members and adding additional overtime and pressure on the workforce.” The provincial health ministry said Monday that three per cent of all health-care workers, excluding those in direct care long-term care homes, are not vaccinated. The percentages range from a high of five per cent in Interior Health and four per cent in Northern Health to a low of one per cent in Providence Health Care. Two per cent of workers in Fraser Health, Vancouver Coastal Health, Vancouver Island Health and the Provincial Health Services Authority were unvaccinated, the ministry said. Those health-care workers fully vaccinated averaged 94 per cent in all health authorities, ranging from a low of 90 per cent in Interior Health and 92 per cent in Northern Health to a high of 97 per cent in Providence Health Care. Workers in Fraser Health, Vancouver Coastal Health, Vancouver Island Health and the Provincial Health Services Authority were between 95 and 96 per cent vaccinated, according to the health ministry. Workers choosing not to vaccinate without a valid reason were told by their own union, the Hospital Employees Union, they faced “definite employment consequences.” Spokesman Mike Old said the union has an obligation to support its members and would review any grievances on merit, and “anybody can go to the B.C. Human Rights Tribunal” with a complaint. But he admitted the odds of winning a decision at the tribunal are slim. Old said long-term and assisted-living homes are required by law to ensure all workers are vaccinated. Workers will have a chance to apply for medical exemptions, but conditions for those are strict, he added. Workers at acute care are required to be vaccinated on Tuesday, but they have another two weeks to comply before being terminated. The same percentage, about four per cent, of acute care workers refused vaccination. The B.C. Nurses’ Union has been encouraging its members to get vaccinated, but stopped short of supporting the mandatory vaccine. Health Employers Association of B.C. said workers who refuse vaccination “as of the applicable date (Oct. 12 for long-term care and assisted living, and Oct. 26 for acute and community) should then be placed on unpaid leave for a period of two weeks, during which the employer will contact the individual worker to discuss their intentions and offer to support them in getting vaccinated,” a health ministry spokeswoman said in an email. “If, at the end of two weeks, the worker has still refused vaccination, they will be issued a termination letter in accordance with any collective agreement requirements associated with that action,” she said. “Specific circumstances for individual workers may vary and employers are expected to exercise judgement in applying these guidelines.” The ministry “anticipates that the majority of grievances will arise in relation to cases where termination letters are issued (which would likely begin later this week),” she said. slazaruk@postmedia.com"
21,"Oct 20, 2021","Vancouver Coastal Health will take over Little Mountain Place, a long-term care home where 41 residents died during a COVID-19 outbreak last winter. The transfer of Little Mountain Place, Little Mountain Court and Adanac Park Lodge, announced late Tuesday, is taking place at the request of the board of the non-profit Little Mountain Residential Care and Housing Society. Bob Breen, president of the board, said Wednesday the society had been facing challenges before the pandemic that included funding and attracting and maintaining staff. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted and exacerbated the challenges, he said. “It really made us realize that we have a duty to the residents that are in the home. And we have a duty to take any steps necessary to make sure that they get the best quality of care possible,” said Breen. He noted there is a provincewide shortage of staff, including nurses, licensed practical nurses and care aides, which also means high overtime costs. It is also hard to attract senior leadership to long-term care because the pay is higher in hospitals, he said. As a smaller organization, Little Mountain simply did not have the resources or economies of scale to have access to financial and human resource expertise, which meant long hours for a CEO who had to take on all of those duties, he said. During the outbreak, Little Mountain lost 60 staff in a short period due to illness and, without the help of Vancouver Coastal Health, would not have been able to operate, Breen said. The benefit of Vancouver Coastal Health is that they have 14,000 employees, a bigger pool to tap into, and financial, human resources, educational and clinical expertise, he said. The board had considered trying to partner with other long-term care homes but decided that would not solve the challenges. Breen also said they might have adopted a different course had the society owned the land in Vancouver instead of leasing it. Breen said other smaller homes could face similar decisions, as there are no simple solutions to the challenges facing smaller care-home organizations, and more money alone would not solve issues such as a shortage of staff. The B.C. government is in the midst of a review of funding for long-term care homes. In the recent past, health authorities have taken over temporary administration of long-term care homes for operational problems, including Interior Health’s continuing takeover of Summerland Seniors Village, but the transfer of ownership to health authorities is not common. The Vancouver Coastal Health Authority did not make someone available Wednesday for an interview. A statement released Tuesday evening says the Ministry of Health has approved the transfer of operations and assets from Little Mountain Residential Care and Housing Society. The transfer includes two facilities near Queen Elizabeth Park: Little Mountain Place, a 116-bed long-term care home for seniors, and Little Mountain Court, a 96-unit independent living facility. It also includes Adanac Park Lodge, a 73-bed long-term care home for younger adults with complex needs, on Boundary Road south of East Hastings. The transfer is expected to be completed in the next few months. Bob Chapman, interim vice-president of the health authority, said in a statement it has worked with the society to support management of the three facilities, but is now gathering necessary approvals and consulting with stakeholders in advance of the takeover. “The transfer of these facilities to VCH will provide long-term stability for staff and help ensure safe, quality care for residents,” said Chapman. A health authority inspection of Little Mountain Place in early January found staffing was low and cleaning was inadequate, as the virus spread throughout the long-term care home following the outbreak that was declared on Nov. 22. Of 114 residents living at Little Mountain Place, 99 ultimately tested positive for the illness. Figures from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control show 72 staff also became ill, but none died. — With files from The Canadian Press ghoekstra@postmedia.com twitter.com/gordon_hoekstra"
22,"Oct 17, 2021","As the season of darkness and rain descends, the spectre of lowered mood, heightened anxiety and seasonal depression looms. The global pandemic has added an additional stressor to those vulnerable to mood disorders. “Stress plays a role,” said Dr. Raymond Lam, an expert in seasonal affective disorder. “People who have clinical depression can have their depression start earlier, have symptoms worsen, and people with mild or winter symptoms can have major symptoms such as sadness, lowered mood, oversleeping, overeating.” According to a recentIpsos Reid poll, nearly three in 10 Canadians have reported a deterioration in mental health since the beginning of the pandemic, and according toStats Canada, more Canadian adults screened positive for anxiety or major depressive disorder in 2021 than in 2020. Lam, professor and B.C. leadership chair in depression research at UBC, said the best way to prepare for the season is to anticipate it, and understand our defences may be down due to the pressures of the pandemic. “Not having the usual things that help with our resilience, such as exercise, gatherings, and friendships, means our coping behaviours are reduced,” said Lam. For those who have seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, a mood disorder that strikes during the autumn and winter seasons,light therapy, or exposure to 30 minutes of bright, artificial light a day, is a well-known, safe and effective treatment. However, Lam said research shows that even when skies are grey, exposure to natural light is beneficial. Lam also suggests we get moving. “Exercise by itself helps depression, even clinical depression, and specifically for winter depression it is helpful.” So what happens when restrictions, fear of COVID-19 infections or a dislike of being outdoors in bad weather keeps us from staying active? New research by Dr. Eli Puterman has found that at-home exercise through fitness apps is an effective tool in managing depression. At the beginning of pandemic restrictions in 2020, Puterman, an associate professor in the school of kinesiology at UBC, said that he heard countless stories from people he met who were suffering from isolation, loneliness and depression. Puterman, a health psychologist, had maintained his workouts during lockdown using Down Dog, an app that provides a variety of exercise programs. He researched whether at-home exercise apps could provide some relief. The results of his study, published last week in theBritish Journal of Sports Medicine, showed that at-home app-based workouts, especially those using a combination of high intensity interval training and yoga, provided significant reductions in depressive symptoms. The study randomized a group of 334 women and men between 18-64 years old who were not involved in high levels of exercise, and assigned them to either yoga, HIIT, or both, and a control group was asked to maintain their current level of exercise. Participants using the app all exhibited a steady decrease in their depression symptoms regardless of the type of exercise they did, and those with the most significant depression symptoms had the most dramatic improvements. “The people in the study group categorized as having some kind of significant depression saw a drastic change,” said Puterman. “A good 70 per cent of them could no longer be categorized as having significant depression by the end of the study.” Twenty minutes of vigorous exercise, four times a week, was enough to make a difference, said Puterman with those who used a combination of yoga and HIIT training receiving the greatest benefit. Puterman said he hopes that public policy will shift to providing tools, tax incentives and education programs to help people incorporate more exercise into their routines. At the individual level, Puterman reminds people to start slowly. “Even a walk around the block can help,” he said. Puterman also suggests using covered spaces in parks and school grounds to exercise outdoors, to get the added benefit of natural light exposure and fresh air. dryan@postmedia.com"
23,"Oct 12, 2021","About four per cent of the 49,000 people who work at B.C.’s long-term and assisted-living homes hadn’t been vaccinated for COVID-19 by Tuesday, the first day apublic health order requiring them to have at least one dose as a condition of their employment came into effect. A similar order is coming later this month for health care workers in acute and community care settings. For one of the largest LTCs, Menno Place in Abbotsford with 675 employees, that meant nine permanent workers and 19 casual employees were forbidden by a public health order from working and face termination in two weeks unless they get vaccinated, said CEO Karen Biggs. “Some people chose to retire at this time rather than be vaccinated,” she told Postmedia via email. “Others are on long term disability or leaves so we don’t know their vaccination status.” The province has collected data from all but four of the 546 long-term and assisted-living homes in the province. Of the 48,897 staff members approximately 96 per cent have had their first dose, and 93 per cent have had both doses. Any scheduled workers who hadn’t been vaccinated were placed on immediate leave, according to Biggs. “Unvaccinated staff go on unpaid leave until the (Oct.) 26,” said Biggs. “After that date, if they have not started a vaccination plan, they will be terminated so we can post their positions permanently, with benefits.” Workers who choose not to be vaccinated will face “definite employment consequences,” said Mike Old of the Hospital Employees’ Union, which represents 20,000 of the workers in senior homes, most of them care aides. He said the union has an obligation to support its members and would review any grievances on merit. And he said “anybody can go the B.C. human rights tribunal” with a complaint but he admitted the odds of winning a decision at the tribunal are slim. Old said long-term and assisted-living homes are required by law to ensure all workers are vaccinated. Workers will have a chance to apply for a medical exemptions but conditions for those are strict, he added. Under new provisions of the health order released this weekend, workers with one dose as of Tuesday could continue to work as long as they wear PPE, get regular rapid tests and plan a second dose in 28 to 35 days. Those with zero doses can keep their jobs if they get their first dose before Oct. 25, after which they would remain off work for another seven days and then will need to follow the same prevention precautions when resuming work."
24,,"B.C.’s long-term care homes and assisted living facilities will again be able to request staff work in more than one facility should they face staff shortages. A last-minute public health order to that effect was issued as employees at such facilities are required to be fully vaccinated by Tuesday, Oct. 12. The exemption for vaccinated workers to work in more than one facility is a reversal of a health order issued in March 2020 designed to help stop the deadly spread of COVID-19 in those facilities, and it is one of many “extraordinary interventions” health authorities are advising home operators to use to deal with any staff shortage as a result of the vaccination order. “Operators should assume that all staff who have not had dose one by Friday, Oct. 8, will likely be ineligible to work” on Tuesday, said the directive from the public health office, dated Friday. Health ministry staff didn’t return a request for comment on the holiday Monday. “There is definitely going to be some gaps in staffing levels,” said Mike Klassen, spokesman for the B.C. Care Providers Association. “Some operators are going to find it more difficult than others.” Klassen said it’s not known how many of the 40,000 workers in long term care and assisted living homes remain unvaccinated. Health Minister Adrian Dix has said it is likely health care workers are inoculated at a higher rate than the provincial average. As of Friday, 73 per cent of all British Columbians were fully vaccinated. B.C. has warned operators to be prepared for staff shortages and has set out three tiers of escalating remedies. In the planning stage, homes are first advised to call on all available employees, hire casual workers, change schedules, offer overtime shifts, cancel discretionary leave, call workers back from vacation and not accept any new residents. If the shortages continue, operators should be prepared to implement “extraordinary interventions,” including the single-site order exemptions for vaccinated staff and to employ retired workers, those deployed to vaccination centres, students, recent graduates and managers and to use outside service providers, like food delivery services. They should consider cancelling outings, recreational activities and adult day programs for residents and visitors. “The worst case scenario is that they’re going to start closing beds,” not by removing residents but by suspending admissions, said Klassen. If the homes are still struggling with staff levels, health authorities could create “float teams” of staff that could be sent to facilities needing help within the five authorities. The latest public health order is for workers to be fully vaccinated by Tuesday but workers with one dose can work if they get their second dose in 28 to 35 days, wear PPE and get rapid tested. Those with no dose by Tuesday have until Oct. 26 to get a first jab. But they can’t work until seven days after their first dose and must plan to get a second dose in 28 to 35 days, wear PPE and get rapid testing. The province has also mandated visitors to care homes have proof of at least one COVID vaccination dose by Oct. 12 and two doses by Nov. 30. The mandatory vaccine order will be in place until rescinded by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. B.C.’s attorney general “will address any legal challenges brought against” the public health officer, the province said."
25,"Oct 11, 2021","Low-income seniors living in a co-op in two highrises in Burnaby face a precarious future as early as November because the union owning the property reportedly wants to sell it for more than $100 million. Thom Armstrong, CEO of theCo-operative Housing Federation of B.C., said residents of the 244 units at115 Place Housing Co-operativecould see their rents increase between 40 and 100 per cent once new owners take over Nov. 1. The co-op now charges $771 a month for a 475 square foot studio and $1,227 for a 826 sq. ft two-bedroom apartment. The pension plan ofLocal 115 of the International Union of Operating Engineershas decided to sell its property after 41 years. The co-op’s lease with Local 115 expires at the end of October. Armstrong said what’s happening with 115 Place is a perfect example of housing becoming financialized and turned into a commodity rather than being treated as a home where people live. “The imperative to seek the highest and best return on an investment is fine if it’s a copper mine,” he said. “If it’s people’s homes, you end up with a result that looks just like this.” The cooperative housing federation advocates on behalf of 115 Place and most of the 269 housing co-ops in B.C. Duncan Beaton lives in a two-bedroom unit in 115 Place with his girlfriend. He described the co-op as a vital, dynamic place with an active social committee. He said most of the residents are in their mid-to-late 50s and older. The oldest is 102. “This is like an urban village,” he said. “It’s a community — it’s tightly knit. They take care of each other because they’re getting old.” He said the degree to which residents are feeling devastated and fearful “is not to be understated.” “I’m not kidding about people not surviving a move.” Beaton, 73, said he expects to be gone once rents increase. He thinks he’ll head east to Maple East or Pitt Meadows to be closer to his children. “These are people who have worked for a living at lower-paid jobs without a lot of benefits all their lives,” he said. “They felt safe here — and now they’re not feeling safe.” Armstrong said the two towers at 9380 and 9390 Cardston Pl. are on the market with Colliers as a private listing. What that means is that the listing agency only approaches buyers likely to have the money to buy the towers. Getting details of the offer requires signing a non-disclosure form, he said. Based on what he said was incomplete information about failed talks between the province and the union pension plan over selling the property, the union pension plan is looking for “well north of $100 million” for the two towers. “They want millions and millions of dollars more than the appraised value,” Armstrong said. Asked about wanting more than $100 million for the two towers, Local 115 said in an emailed statement that the pension plan hasn’t put a purchase price on the property as “prospective purchasers will make offers based on what they think the property is worth.” “The pension plan has put restrictions in the purchase agreement that would limit impacts on existing residents, including protection from evictions and renovictions,” Claudia Ferris, pension plan spokeswoman, said in the statement. Ferris said the pension plan has “exhausted every conceivable option to conclude a fair and equitable sale agreement” with B.C. Housing over several years. “We are really left with no choice but to take these properties to market,” she said. A spokesperson for David Eby, attorney-general and minister responsible for Housing, said in an emailed statement that B.C. Housing “made an appropriate offer to purchase the site based on an independent property appraisal. Unfortunately, the landowner decided to list the property on the private market.” “The appraisal and exact details of potential purchase negotiations are both confidential, therefore we cannot share them,” the statement said. The ministry said in the statement that it was open to continuing talks to buy the property “so that residents aren’t forced to leave their home.” “But we are also committed to being fiscally responsible with public dollars and only make purchases when they are priced consistent with third-party valuations.” Armstrong said that the pension plan’s promise to protect people living in 115 Place is “just so much empty hot air.” “You can’t bind a purchaser to treat existing residents a certain way once the sale is closed,” he said. Armstrong said once the lease agreement expires at the end of this month, residents will be without protection under the Co-op or Residential Tenancy acts. “It’s just a horrible situation to contemplate,” he said. Local 115 owns the land leased by another Burnaby co-op called Post 83. Armstrong said that while Local 115 hasn’t indicated what will happen when Post 83’s lease expires at the end of October 2022, everyone expects the 181 members living there to face the same fate as 115 Place. Local 115represents 12,000 workers in B.C., such as heavy equipment operators, mechanics, operating engineers and aerial firefighters. Projects built by its members include the Golden Ears Bridge and the B.C. Place Stadium roof. kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
26,"Oct 01, 2021","The day Shin Noh went missing, he was seen by a member of his Coquitlam church who didn’t realize he might be lost. Several others also encountered the retired pastor on that day, Sept. 18, 2013, although his family didn’t learn of the sightings until several days later. By then, the odds of finding him alive and in good health had significantly diminished, said his son, Sam Noh. Shin Noh had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease several years earlier. He sometimes forgot dates, or when he last ate. Out of respect for his privacy, his family kept his dementia confidential. On good days, they hoped he might be returning to his old self. “My family was very ill-equipped to deal with it,” said Sam Noh. “For years he’d gone for walks. If you tried to stop him, he could get quite upset.” When his dad didn’t return from his morning walk that morning, Noh contacted police, although he privately wondered if it was too soon to sound the alarm. In the days that followed, searchers, including family and friends,chased every lead, including an unconfirmed report that homeless people living on Burke Mountain may have given the missing man food. But Shin Noh was never found. “It took a long time to realize there’s no way he could be alive,” said Sam Noh. “As a family, you have this hope that he might still be out there. After eight years, we want closure, but I think we might never get it.” Noh’s family is not alone in their loss. In May 2020, an 88-year-old Delta senior with dementia wasfound deadin a wooded area near the Alex Fraser Bridge after he went missing from his nearby home. In 2019, two missing seniors with dementia, both from Chilliwack, were found dead several months apart, while a Maple Ridge man with dementia remains missing. Eight years after his father disappeared, Noh has become a lay expert on dementia and wandering. B.C. Silver Alert, an advocacy group co-founded by Noh and Coquitlam Search and Rescue volunteer Michael Coyle, tracks missing seniors through police press releases. Each year, on average, they issue about 29 alerts over social media asking their followers to be on the lookout for someone. In a major city like Vancouver, there are sometimesmultiple press releases per week, the vast majority ending with a positive outcome. On Sept. 20, Vancouver Police asked for the public’s help to find an 80-year-old man who had been dropped off near Vancouver General Hospital for a medical appointment, but never made it inside. The following morning, another press release indicated he had been located. But while anecdotal evidence suggests missing seniors are a serious issue, a lack of data makes it difficult to know if the problem is increasing. “You need statistics to inform policy,” said Noelannah Neubauer, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Waterloo who helped spearhead the development of the International Consortium on Dementia and Wayfinding. “What you’re seeing in B.C. is happening across the country as you have an aging population and there’s more people with dementia. But the data isn’t there.” There are more than 500,000Canadians living with dementiatoday, according to the Alzheimer Society of Canada, with that number expected to rise to 912,000 by 2030. It’s believed that six out of 10 people living with dementia will wander at least once, and many do so repeatedly. In her work with first responders, Neubauer said she’s been told missing seniors are quickly becoming the top category of missing people in many jurisdictions. “That’s scary because seniors often have health complications,” she said. “We know we will see more and more deaths.” As a police officer who reviews the files of many of B.C.’s missing people, Cpl. Jennifer Sparkes has a unique perspective. Across 45 RCMP detachments from the B.C. Interior to the Alberta border, Sparkes sees about 3,000 missing persons files each year. About two per cent of those cases involve people with dementia. In 2021 so far, there have been 43 reports of missing seniors with dementia. All but one was concluded with the person located alive on the same day they were reported missing. “These cases are always treated as high risk and high priority because of the nature of dementia,” said Sparkes, the missing persons coordinator for B.C. RCMP E division’s Southeast District. “But I’m very encouraged when I look at the outcomes.” Compared to other missing people, missing seniors are usually located quickly by police, family, caregivers or the public, while some return on their own. “This category of files also tends to have an excellent support system, which makes it so much easier,” she said. “Many of the (other) people reported missing don’t have a support system.” In Vancouver, these cases also tend to be resolved quickly, although there are sometimes several in a week. “We see about 12 per month, or three or four per week,” said Vancouver Police Sgt. Teresa Wager. “It’s very weather-dependent,” added Det. Rebecca Matson. “If the weather is nice, we’ll see numbers increase.” While cases usually end well, the two members of VPD’s missing persons unit said the experience is traumatic for families and caregivers. “It’s devastating,” said Wager. “They’re upset, looking everywhere, printing posters.” For the missing person, the experience may be disorientating. Wager recalled someone who walked almost 30 kilometres and seemed unaware they were lost. Another person took transit to Surrey. Dangers, particularly in bad weather, include succumbing to the elements, becoming lost in an inaccessible place like heavy brush, or falling. Yet experts agree autonomy is an important part of well-being for people with dementia. “Mobility is a critical part of quality of life,” said Habib Chaudhury, chair of Simon Fraser University’s gerontology department. “Unfortunately, it’s also where wandering becomes an issue.” In North America, we tend to prioritize safety and security over autonomy and quality of life, he said, pointing to locked dementia wards in some care facilities. In other countries, the scale tips in the other direction, with more innovative approaches to managing patients through building design or technology. Understanding why someone might desire to wander can help caretakers to find a balance, said Lillian Hung, an assistant professor in the University of B.C.’s nursing department. Many times, wandering is the result of an unmet need. “If caregivers have better skills to realize what is happening — ask them, can I help you find something, can you tell me more about what you’re looking for? — it may address that unmet need,” said Hung. The person might be searching for a place or person from their past, or responding to a change in their environment, she said. They might feel restless and want to move, or have a physical need they can’t express. “Wander denotes aimless movement,” said Kim McKercher, a provincial coordinator with the Alzheimer Society of B.C. “To the individual, there is meaning behind it.” Thesociety advises familiesto remove triggers, such as a jacket or keys from the front door, and to be aware of a person’s past routines, like when they used to leave for work, and engage them during that time. Stigma around cognitive disorders can sometimes prevent people with dementia from discussing how they want their families to manage the disease as it progresses, said Lili Liu, a professor in the school of public health sciences at the University of Waterloo who specializes in aging and technology. Experts advise creating a care plan that uses multiple strategies to balance autonomy and safety. “Do they want technology to be part of their care?” she said. If so, they might get in the habit of carrying a device that could be capable of tracking them in the future. Consent is key. “Some might say no camera, but I’m OK with sensors.” In 2013, police in the United Kingdomconducted a trialto give seniors prone to wandering GPS trackers. The program cost about $700 per month, but was anticipated to save thousands more by avoiding callouts. But the initiative was condemned by the National Pensioners Convention. “This is trying to solve a human problem with technology. Rather than tagging people we need better social care out in the community,” general secretary Dot Gibson told local media. While technology is one strategy, it’s not foolproof, said Neubauer. Tracking devices often need to be charged, and the person must tolerate wearing one. GPS can be inaccurate near tall buildings or on underground transit systems. When Chilliwack senior John Pop went missing in 2019, his daughter told media he usually wore a GPS watch that provided alerts to family members. The watch had recently stopped working and they were in the process of getting a new one when he disappeared. The family also had a door alarm, but his wife was doing dishes in the kitchen and didn’t hear it when he left the house. Pop’s body was found four days later near a local trail. Another approach to keeping people safe involves providing police and searchers with more information. MedicAlert, a charity that promotes medical ID bracelets, offers a blue version for people with cognitive issues. First responders can access a file of information submitted by the person or their family in advance, including medical information, current photographs, past history and triggers. All MedicAlert information is self-reported, not from hospitals, said president Leslie McGill. “We’d love to provide that access, but we’re not there yet.” Since his father’s disappearance, Sam Noh has been advocating the B.C. government to create a geo-targetedSilver Alert systemsimilar to the Amber Alert program, which could be activated by police in specific communities when a senior goes missing. During the 2020 provincial election campaign, Premier John Horgan met with Noh andpledgedto “continue to advocate” for the system. But some believe Silver Alert could lead to “alert fatigue” among the public, or might infringe upon a person’s privacy. “Silver Alert is not the ultimate solution,” Noh admitted. “But we need to use all the tools available for a complex problem.” Perhaps one of the best ways to keep people with dementia safe while promoting autonomy isn’t a tool at all, but rather a societal shift that would make communities more “dementia-friendly.” Mario Gregorio, a dementia advocate who has worked as a co-researcher on several UBC studies, is proud that Burnaby was among the first communities in B.C. to complete a “dementia-friendly action plan” with the Alzheimer Society of B.C. He’s participated in several “walkabouts” with city staff and first responders in an effort to teach them what it’s like to navigate the city as someone with dementia. “I’m very encouraged that people are listening,” he said. Gregorio’s insights have helped inform the design of new public spaces to ensure “entrances really look like entrances,” sidewalks are clearly delineated from other spaces and that there are landmarks to make it easier to navigate, said Margaret Manifold, senior social planner for the City of Burnaby. Front-line staff have also received training to assist people with dementia. “I think it raises the level of awareness,” she said. “We want to be more inclusive of people with cognitive impairments.” A shift is also taking place in long-term care to recognize people with dementia have a right to independence. Billed as Canada’s first “dementia village,” The Village Langley doesn’t use the term “beds” or “facility” to describe its long-term care and assisted-living homes, said executive director Adrienne Alford-Burt. Within the seven-acre gated community, inspired by a similar concept in the Netherlands, villagers are free to “self-direct” their movement and move freely around the community, visiting the hair salon or pub, according to their mobility and safety requirements. “We make sure people have the opportunity to control their day within a safe environment,” said Alford-Burt. B.C. seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie said wandering is sometimes the reason someone must move to long-term care, although some families choose to put safeguards in place, such as technology, to “mitigate some of the dangers.” A more “coordinated approach” to dementia involving various stakeholders and solutions could help people stay at home longer, she said. “I think there is more we can do with the public to give people greater confidence that someone is watching out for them.” gluymes@postmedia.com twitter.com/glendaluymes Vancouver Police Sgt. Teresa Wager and Det. Rebecca Matson shared a few simple steps that families can take that can later help police find a lost senior. • If the person has a Compass Card or transit pass, record the number. “We can track that super easy and that will tell us if they’ve taken SkyTrain or the bus,” said Matson. “Families never have that number, but many people have been found using transit. Bus drivers have actually found a lot people for us.” • Consider using technology to track the person when they’re out alone. This doesn’t have to be complicated, said Wager. Certain phone apps allow tracking, while GPS trackers, like Apple AirTags, can be sewn into a jacket or hat. • Ensure you have a current photo. “If the person always wears a blue jacket and a Tilly hat, take a picture of them wearing that,” said Wager. “Nothing sucks more than when we have to use a passport or drivers’ licence photo. No one looks like themselves in those pictures.” • Don’t hesitate to report. “It’s a bad TV myth that you have to wait 24 hours to report a missing person,” said Matson. “Never feel bad about reaching out to us.” Police treat vulnerable missing people as a high priority. “If we can get out there quickly, it really helps. We’ve had the helicopter out in some case.” • Encourage the person to wear a lanyard with their name, address and phone number on it. • Know the person’s favourite places to visit, including past addresses, workplaces, places they like to shop, familiar parks and walking routes. People are often found close to home."
27,"Sep 08, 2021","The province says foothold traps being used to catch and kill coyotes in Stanley Park have been modified to minimize the risk of pain to the wild animals. But Rebeka Breder, an animal rights lawyer, said Wednesday she believes the traps will cause “excruciating pain” and “enormous amount of suffering” to the trapped animal. “They’re baiting leghold traps. They’re saying they’ll be padded. That doesn’t bring me any comfort whatsoever,” Breder said. “These leghold traps essentially slam down on what gets stuck — usually it’s a paw, sometimes it’s a neck.” Last week, the provincial government said it would kill up to 35 coyotes to protect public safety. Since December, 2020, there have been reports of 45 attacks by coyotes on people in the park. Five attacks were on children. The Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development said in a statement Wednesday that one coyote had been caught and killed overnight. The ministry said the coyotes are being caught in “modified foothold traps” which are continuously monitored by camera, so that the amount of time a coyote spends in the trap is minimized. “The mechanism for these type of traps minimizes the risk of any pain or damage to the animal,” the ministry said. The province has contracted professional trappers to help catch the coyotes. Once caught, a provincial wildlife officer is called to sedate the animal and then kill it using a bolt gun, a device “used routinely to humanely kill livestock.” The ministry said the “stomach contents will be preserved and analyzed to determine diet.” The animals will also be tested for diseases. The ministry was unable to say what necropsies have shown from coyotes that were killed in the park earlier this year. The province did not make anyone available for interviews on Wednesday and is only taking reporters’ questions in writing. Breder said she’d like to know what kind of measures the government is planning to take to get at the root cause of what’s going on in Stanley Park between coyotes and humans. “Probably more important to me is that there has been a lack of enforcement on the prohibition to feed wildlife,” she said. TheB.C. Conservation Officer Service has said no ticketshave been issued for illegally feeding wildlife in Stanley Park. Breder said the lack of enforcement infuriates her. “It is illegal to feed wildlife. Why on earth have they not enforced this law?” she said. “Some people need a $500 ticket — I would suggest a very high fine — to learn their lesson.” Earlier Wednesday, Mayor Kennedy Stewart said Vancouver is playing a supportive role to both the B.C. Conservation Officer Service and the park board. “I’m really sad for the need to cull the coyotes,” he said at an online news conference. “I just feel really sad about the whole thing but I understand why because of public safety.” Stewart said the city will be reviewing “the situation with the park board and B.C. Conservation Officer Service to see what the city of Vancouver can do to make sure this doesn’t happen again.” The park board expects to have coyote-proof garbage bins in place this week. As well, there will be multilingual “Don’t feed Coyotes” signs to reflect the largest language groups in Vancouver. Signs will be in Tagalog, the main language spoken the Philippines, and in simplified and traditional Chinese characters. Stanley Park remains closed to the public from 7 p.m. to 9 a.m. daily. All trails inside the park are closed at all times. When the park is open, the public is asked to only use the seawall, open grassy areas, paved roads and businesses. Astudypublished in 2018 found that the range of coyotes has “dramatically expanded since 1900.” The study, which looked at where coyotes have been found the past 10,000 years, described Canis latrans (the Latin name for the species) as an “incredibly adaptive carnivore” that’s been able to expand its geographic range by about 40 per cent or “at least twice as much as any other North American carnivore during the same time period.” It attributed the expansion to factors that included the elimination of predator species such as wolves and cougars. Traditionally, coyotes have been found in grasslands, prairies and deserts but learned to adapt to forested areas in the early 20th century. “Coyote expansion began around 1900 as they moved north into taiga forests, east into deciduous forests, west in coastal temperature rain forests, and south into rainforests,” thestudy’s abstract says. The Vancouver Sun first reported about coyotes in Stanley Park in 1988. kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
28,,"Menno Place is bracing for staffing problems on Oct. 12, when all workers at the large seniors community in Abbotsford will need to be vaccinated to be able to work. Some 675 employees work at the sprawling seniors complex that includes 700 residents in long-term care and independent and assisted living in six buildings. With the province’s mandatory staff vaccination announcement for those who work in seniors care a month ago, CEO Karen Biggs is worried about how much of her staff will be lost. Staff at hospitals and health care workers who work in the community aren’t required to be immunized against COVID, and she fears she may lose five to 10 per cent of her staff to acute care facilities or to community care, such as in-home care workers. “We’re all extremely concerned,” said Biggs. “My staff are literally across the street right now from Abbotsford Regional Hospital and Cancer Centre, and they can just walk over and get a job. We’re like sitting ducks. I’m losing one of my best (kitchen staffers).” In the weekly calls with health ministry officials and public health officials, “we are talking to Bonnie Henry and we’re saying come on, this is not right. We’re desperately trying to tell them that you have to apply it (mandatory vaccination) across the board.” The B.C. Care Providers Association, an industry group that represents the province’s care-home operators, says it has heard similar worries from its members and is estimating a 10 per cent loss of staff across the sector because of the mandatory vaccine. “We are seeing people leaving long-term care to work in acute care (at hospitals),” said association CEO Terry Lake. Provincial health officials said last week they are working on a plan to ensure all health care workers are vaccinated. Biggs said policy changes prompted by hundreds of deaths in long-term care homes at the start of COVID that forbade health-care workers from working in more than one facility caused staffing shortages. “We lost 39 casuals when single-site rules came in,” she said. And the facility was hit by a recent outbreak, which sent 14 staff, all doubly vaccinated, home sick. “We’ve had a horrible summer and the fall is going to be worse,” she said. “We’re not unique. It’s happening everywhere.” Biggs also said she doesn’t know what will happen when the deadline for staff vaccinations arrive. “(The provincial health order) doesn’t say what will happen,” she said. “We don’t know if they’re terminated or if they’re suspended.” She expects the workers’ union will fight to save their jobs through grievances or there may be human rights challengers. “I think it’s going to be a legal nightmare … with years of wrangling,” she said. Wednesday was the deadline for care homes to submit a staff list indicating what percentage are vaccinated and Biggs said that process was beset by computer problems. The digital portal became available and when Menno Place sent in the list, it came back with 300 errors, including messages that the names didn’t match because the province had only initials for the employee and the home’s list used the full name. “All the administrators we talked to were having the same problem (uploading data),” she said. Lake said “technical glitches” were widespread and a number of operators didn’t make Wednesday’s deadline. He has requested the health ministry use data already collected through vaccine passports, rather than have the homes create systems for data collection and submission at great time and expense. He said he has also requested the province sign an order that would require all new health-care hires to be doubly vaccinated, which would eliminate part of the problem of staffers migrating to hospitals. Menno Place shows a 95 per cent vaccination rate, said Biggs. But she isn’t certain how accurate the percentage is because it is based on self-reporting. A health ministry spokeswoman wasn’t able to respond to questions in time. The Hospital Employees Union, which represents workers at long-term care homes, didn’t return requests for comment. slazaruk@postmedia.com Get the latest COVID-19 news delivered to your inbox weeknights at 7 p.m. bysubscribing to our newsletter here.

29,"Aug 19, 2021","Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau used a seniors’ care home in Victoria as the backdrop to announce that if elected his government would spend $9 billion on long-term care, including a pay raise for those who work in seniors care homes. “We have seen unacceptable and heartbreaking conditions in long-term care homes in Canada during this (COVID-19) pandemic,” said Trudeau. “We believe conditions of work become conditions of care for our seniors.” Trudeau said that’s why his party will increase the minimum wage to $25 an hour for personal service workers in care homes. And, he said, he will work with the provinces “to continue to address the shortfalls in Canada’s long-term care sector.” Trudeau said the money would be spent to create more beds, increase infection prevention and to double the tax break given to seniors who live at home. The existing federal home accessibility tax credit would increase to a maximum of $20,000. It can be used to offset the costs for a range of devices, from installing wheelchair ramps and lifts to bathtub hand bars. Although seniors care isn’t a federal responsibility, Trudeau said, “the federal government will not micromanage long-term care.” Instead, his government would use the same model to share costs with provinces as it has used with its $10-a day child care agreements. Those agreements allow each province to decide how to spend the money, as along as child-care costs are cut in half within a year, and are lowered to $10 a day in five years. Trudeau didn’t offer specifics about the long-term care plan, including when the program would begin, its time frame for spending or how costs would be shared with the provinces. The Liberal leader also spent time slamming his Tory opponents, saying: “We can’t let the Conservatives take Canada backwards.” However, there are no Conservative incumbents on Vancouver Island. Trudeau’s campaign stop took place in the riding of former Green party leader Elizabeth May. The only other federal Green seat is held by Paul Manley in Nanaimo. Vancouver Island’s five other ridings are held by New Democrats. lcordasco@postmedia.com Start your day with a roundup of B.C.-focused news and opinion delivered straight to your inbox at 7 a.m., Monday to Friday by subscribing to ourSunrise newsletter here."
30,"Aug 11, 2021","The province has moved into “high gear” in anticipation of another heat wave in Metro Vancouver and other areas of southern B.C., Health Minister Adrian Dix said Wednesday,implementing several measures that include covering the cost of staff and water at neighbourhood cooling centres. Officials are also calling on the public to check in with neighbours, family members and friends who are living alone to make sure they are keeping cool and hydrated. “The province is geared up and ready to help people through another heat wave, along with our partners in the health authorities and local governments,” Dix said. “Services in health authorities are fully prepared to help anyone who might experience heat- or smoke-related challenges.” Environment Canadahas issued a heat warning for Metro Vancouver and southern Vancouver Island from Thursday to Sunday. During an online news conference, Dix outlined a number of practical measures that have been implemented, such as increasing staff at hospital emergencies to meet expected demand. “If you or a loved one experience heat-related illness and you need help, please call 911.

Ambulance Service remains ready to serve you,” he said. “Paramedics and dispatchers are on deck to get help quickly to people who call for it.” From Thursday to Sunday, staff withHealthLink B.C. at 811call centres have been told to expect higher-than-normal call volumes. “We have all hands on deck to get British Columbians through the heat,” Dix said. “I’ve seen how British Columbians have been reaching out to support one another in the heat, reminding their neighbours and loved ones to stay safe by keeping cool. Thank you for everything you’re doing, every one of you.” Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said temperatures are not expected to reach the same highs as during the last recent heat wave in late June and early July. During that time, the B.C. Coroners Service said 569 people died of heat-related causes. About 80 per cent of those were 65 years of age and older. “Many people here are not acclimatized to this type of temperature, particularly when it does not cool down at night,” Henry said. She said extremely high indoor temperatures can be particularly dangerous for the elderly and anyone with a chronic health condition. If they are living alone, she said, they may not recognize the effects of extreme heat on their bodies. She pointed out that at high temperatures, fans alone can be dehydrating. Their effectiveness can be increased by using a mister, putting an ice tray in front of the fan, or applying moisture to your body with a wet towel. “Right now, the important thing for the next few days is to find ways to stay cool both indoors and outdoors,” she said, adding that it is important to drink water before you feel thirsty. In Burnaby, Doris Mah said the Caring Project started when shecontacted Burnaby Neighbourhood House and the Seniors Services Society in July to ask them what they needed to help seniors with the heat. “They said, ‘Fans, No. 1’.” Mah was able to get more than 50 donated fans to help seniors in need, but more are still needed. “If people have functioning fans they’re not using, please donate them,” she said. Fans can be dropped off at the offices ofNDP MP Peter Julian(New Westminster-Burnaby) andNDP MLA Anne Kang(Burnaby-Deer Lake). People outside of Burnaby, Mah said, can take their own initiative to help seniors in their community. “They can pick up the phone, call their local seniors’ organizations, and ask what they need,” she said. “If they say fans, put it out on social media and gather fans and bring them to the organizations.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
31,"Aug 02, 2021","In the opening of his book, The New Alchemists, author and UBC professor Bernie Garrett compares the rise of deceptive heath care practices and misinformation to the cons perpetrated by Renaissance alchemists, who swindled desperate people with promises of immortality and claims they could turn metal into gold. “Everybody wants to be healthy,” said Garrett. “Everybody has been taken in by some sort of health scam at one point in their life — a product to improve their skin, or lose weight. It’s a normal human desire to try and improve our lives.” But when lives are at stake — or when a global pandemic hits — the outcomes of believing in pseudo-science, deception, scams and misinformation, can be more serious. “It’s not just a question about losing money, some of these things can be detrimental and prevent people from getting effective treatment,” said Garrett, who cites several well-known cases that have had tragic outcomes, such as the death of atoddler in Albertawhose parents used natural remedies, rather than seek medical treatment for their seriously ill child. Garret started writing the book in 2018 after noticing an increase in deceptive health care practices fuelled by the internet. Then came the COVID-19 pandemic, with its plethora of misinformation and fraudulent tests, cures, immune-boosting agents, anti-vaccination rhetoric, and fake cures, from bleach to sunlight. Watching the explosion of misinformation play out in real time as he wrote the book was fascinating, said Garrett, who compared it to bailing out a leaky boat: for every theory that was debunked, a new one would replace it. “For my colleagues working in the ICUs and acute care units across the country, the effects of this pandemic are horrific, and any misinformation that prolongs it has serious consequences,” said Garrett, who has 35 years of experience in nursing and health care research. Bogus health care claims come in many guises, whether it’s a “magical health machine” or magical technology, unproven supplements, super-juices, fake products, fake clinics, or even fake doctors like teen Malachi A. Love-Robinson, who was caught fraudulently practicing in Florida. “The most egregious are the fake cancer clinics in the way in which they prey on very vulnerable people,” said Garrett. Mistrust of conventional medicine has led to distrust of some public health options, said Garret, in part, because of scandals associated with big pharma. “We’ve had scandals withAbilify,OxyContin,Respiridaland others, where these pharmaceutical companies have behaved very poorly in terms of marketing, and that’s encouraged some people to move away from traditional medicine. ” Deceptive healthcare providers have capitalized on that growing lack of public trust in science and medicine, and social media has fuelled the fire. Studies show that even “absurd” rumours and easily understood falsehoods spread faster on social media networks than solid science, said Garrett who cites Kaiser Family Foundation research that shows 2/3 of unvaccinated adults believed at least one vaccine lie. The psychology of advertising plays a role said Garrett. “These folks are very good at pushing our buttons with buzzwords that appeal to us or invoke fear.” Deceptive health care claimants tend to appeal to emotion rather than logic, and rely on techniques that connect positive social imagery and phrases such as “Moms like this,” or use images of nature, or “ancient traditions.” They tend to rely on testimonials, and claims of groundbreaking or secret research science hasn’t caught up with yet, or the conspiracy theorists favourite: “doctors don’t want you to know this,” said Garrett. “It’s a complex problem,” said Garrett. “With people in our own lives it’s important to debunk these idea when they come forward bypointing out why things are illogical or irrational and correcting misconceptions.” Garret said the “wild west” of health care advertising needs to be better regulated, and our health care systems need to be made more user-friendly so fewer people will seek alternatives. “Some of the key problems we have in health deception in Canada and more broadly are based on this lack of regulation.” dryan@postmedia.com"
32,"Jul 04, 2021","For nearly a month, David Eby and Sheila Malcolmson have had a 27-page proposal on their desks that could radically alter how homelessness, drug addictions and mental health are addressed. While the proposal with its Sept. 1 implementation date has been sitting there, the cabinet ministers have made dozens of announcements similar to what’s been done for close to five years. More group housing. More congregated services. They’ve expressed the usual condolences and regret at the most recent overdose-death numbers — 851 deaths in the first five months of this year already — that has 2021 on-pace to be the worst year ever. In response to that, they and others have renewed calls for decriminalization — which has essentially been in place in Vancouver for most of the last decade — and more free drugs, a so-called ‘safe supply’ that goes beyond what’s normally prescribed to stabilize users and quell cravings. Even with a few dips along the way, the number of deaths have inexorably risen over the past two decades when Vancouver first acknowledged the burgeoning problem with illicit drugs in the Downtown Eastside, and over the past five years since a provincewide public-health emergency was declared. And, so far, silence on theproposalthat has been talked about for close to a year by people including former NDP premier Mike Harcourt, Bill MacEwan, the former head of psychiatry at St. Paul’s Hospital, Simon Fraser University researchers and some non-profit groups. Based on more than 100 peer-reviewed publications and reports, recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and guidance from Indigenous people with lived experiences, SFU psychologist Julian Somers et al insists that there’s a better — and, yes, a cheaper way. The $37 million proposal is for three years and would affect the lives of 1,500 people across B.C. who are the most deeply entrenched homeless, addicted and mentally ill. It’s rooted in research that Somers was involved with nearly a decade ago — the federal government’s $110-million,At Home/Chez Soiproject, which involved 2,000 people across Canada in the largest, randomized trial in history to evaluate solutions for homelessness. Subsequent randomized trials done by SFU researchers supported the findings that people able to live in independent, recovery-oriented housing resulted in a 71 per cent drop in crime, a 50 per cent decrease in their hospital use and improved quality of life and community well-being. For context, here’s what the group’s research on the current situation shows: • There are more than 2,200 British Columbians with mental illness as well as addiction, who over a five-year period average 4.9 hospital admissions, 4.2 court-ordered sentences to custody and 4.4 sentences to community supervision. • Over 80 per cent of those living in The Downtown Eastside moved there from somewhere outside the Vancouver area. • Between 2010 and 2017, involuntary hospitalization rose by roughly 50 per cent. • They are eligible to receive $19,155 in shelter payments and $36,258 in income support. A five-year study in Vancouver of 107 people with concurrent addictions and mental illness found that they spent an average of 59 days in hospital, received income assistance for 48 of 60 possible months, had 19 criminal convictions, spent 590 days in custody and another 631 days under community supervision. So what is independent, recovery-based housing? It starts with listening to what people need, what they want and what they hope for. It includes asking them where they want to live and, again, research suggests that it’s not the Downtown Eastside, modular housing or an SRO. A 2020 Vancouver survey found that 84 per cent would prefer to live somewhere else, away from others with similar problems. And before you NIMBY up, consider that the At Home study placed people in regular apartment buildings around the city, provided the necessary supports and recorded no problems or complaints from the neighbours. Once clients have set their goals, they’re provided with the appropriate psycho-, social and medical services to begin the journey toward improved well-being, health, and meaningful social inclusion. Harm reduction will be part of it. For some, opioid replacement therapy may become a permanent part of their lives, while others may choose abstinence. If they’re able and willing, employment services would be part of it. One international study cited found that between 70 and 90 per cent of people with mental illness and addictions want to work. In some ways, there’s nothing really radical about this plan. It’s exactly what happens when pilots, physicians, public servants and politicians are identified as having substance-use problems. With money available from their employee benefits plans, they’re whisked off to psychologists or counsellors for assessments, residential treatment if required, and then months, if not years, of followup counselling and treatment. But what happens to the poorest and most vulnerable is that they’re revived with naloxone, patched up in hospital, dealt with in the courts and then sent back to the streets or being warehoused and ghettoized in rundown hotels and social housing that provide few of the supports that they need. The evidence points to potentially millions of dollars in public savings offsetting any additional costs if we revised our assumptions that only the wealthy, the powerful or those with employee benefit plans are able to get better or at least deserving of the opportunity to try. The only mystery is why governments haven’t followed the science before and why they’re still slow to do it now. dbramham@postmedia.com twitter:@bramham_daphne"

One elementary school teacher with 10 years experience said they had never felt so “discouraged, unappreciated and deflated, while at the same time burned out.” “Our goal was to understand how B.C. teachers were doing during the pandemic and the potential impact the pandemic may have had on their mental health, but also on their teaching experiences,” said lead authorAnne Gadermann, an assistant professor at UBC’s school of population and public health. The study, carried out in conjunction with the B.C. Teachers Federation and the B.C. Ministry of Education, canvassed 1,206 teachers around the province in February, surveying their teaching experience and well-being after 11 months of COVID-19 restrictions. — Gordon McIntyre 1:15 p.m. –Vaccine uptake needed to reopen border will be tough to meet: economist he federal government wants to see 75 per cent of Canada’s population immunized against COVID-19 with two doses before lifting international travel restrictions and opening the border. It’s a threshold that will be tough to meet, particularly in Alberta, where nearly a quarter of people eligible for a shot still haven’t received a dose, said University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe. Having 75 per cent of Canadians fully immunized means 86 per cent of those aged 12 and over who are eligible for a shot will need to get their jabs, Tombe said. “Eighty-six per cent of eligible individuals is perhaps at the higher end of what polls suggest is possible,” Tombe said. “It’s going to take a little bit more work to change some views that are out there … It’s certainly possible, but it’s going to be a heavy lift for governments.” The federal government has discussed a 75 per cent threshold in recent months, butformalized it in mid-June. The Public Health Agency of Canada says it recognizes mandatory quarantine and testing protocols “place significant burdens” on Canadians and the country’s economy, but that these measures remain the most effective way to prevent new cases and variants of concern from entering the country. – Calgary Herald 12:45 p.m. – Fraser Health walk-in appointment for first dose at all clinics Fraser Health is welcoming walk-in appointments at any of their COVID-19 vaccination clinics to anyone 12 years and older needing first-dose immunizations “All Fraser Health residents are welcome, including those without personal health numbers, vulnerable people and/or people who are not residents of B.C.,” the health authority said in a statement.

That compares with a combined 24 per cent in April in a poll by the same outlets. The data illustrate the challenge for the Biden administration and state and local officials in expanding vaccination beyond the 67 per cent who have received at least one dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the poll, 35 per cent said U.S. officials are exaggerating the threat of the Delta variant of the virus, with more Republicans than Democrats holding that view. The survey found that 86 per cent of Democrats have received at least one shot, compared with 45 per cent of Republicans.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said he spoke with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla about securing more vaccines for Israel and about possible deals to swap vaccines between Israel and other countries, though he did not say which ones. “Contacts are being handled by the Health Ministry, Foreign Ministry and the National Security Council,” Bennett said. The director-general of the Health Ministry, Hezi Levi, said in an interview with Radio 103 FM that the doses expire on July 31 and that any deal would have to win Pfizer’s approval. He did not say how many doses Israel was looking to swap. The Haaretz newspaper put the number at about a million. – Reuters 8 a.m. – Johnson & Johnson recipients seeking mRNA boosters Some people who received the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 shot in the U.S. are seeking out added doses of a messenger-RNA vaccine, fearing their initial inoculation won’t protect them from the virus. Demand for the one-and-done J&J shot has suffered in part due to the perception that it’s inferior to the two-dose mRNA vaccines that showed higher efficacy in clinical trials. But it is unclear if mixing vaccines will safely increase protection, and there are fresh signs that J&J’s shot is a strong shield against variants. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people don’t mix vaccines until robust clinical data validates the benefit and quells concerns about risks. – Bloomberg 8 a.m. – South Africa hits a new record with 26,000 daily COVID-19 cases South Africa hit a record of 26,000 fresh COVID-19 cases on Saturday, its second record-breaking tally in as many days, as a rampant third wave of infections coursed through a largely unvaccinated population.

In an effort to prevent the spread of the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant, Rome last month introduced a five-day quarantine for anyone coming to Italy who had been to Britain in the previous two weeks. By cross-checking names of travelers of flights from England and Ukraine with those who had bought tickets, the Italian police identified 52 fans who had not complied with the required quarantine time.

34,"Jul 03, 2021","An unprecedented number of sudden and unexpected deaths were recorded throughout B.C. during the heat wave that smashed temperature records and sparked wildfires, including the one that razed Lytton and the one that threatened Kamloops. Over the seven days from June 25 to Canada Day, 719 deaths were reported to theB.C. Coroners Service, chief coroner Lisa Lapointe said on Friday afternoon. “This number is preliminary and subject to increase as additional reported deaths are entered into our system,” Lapointe said. “The 719 deaths reported is three times more than what would normally occur in the province during the same period.” The coroners service believes the extreme weather was a significant contributing factor for the huge spike in sudden and unexpected deaths. Temperatures have dropped to more normal levels, in the low to mid 20s and into the teens overnight, for Metro Vancouver, according toEnvironment Canada, and unlike a week ago at this time, there are no weather alerts for Metro Vancouver or the Fraser Valley as of Friday afternoon. But heat warnings remain in effect for much of the rest of the province, including North and South Thompson, Okanagan, Similkameen, Kootenays, Fraser Canyon, Shuswap, Boundary, Elk Valley and Yoho. A provincewide campfire ban remains in effect. First responders scrambled all last week to respond to unprecedented numbers of heat-related health calls. From June 25 to July 1, B.C. Emergency Health Services staff responded to 790 heat-related calls in B.C., bringing the total for June to 824 heat-related calls. There were 14 such calls in June 2020. Greg Schalk, public safety director and fire chief with the city of North Vancouver, saidhis crews would normally respond to 10 calls in a 24-hour period, but during the heat wave that number was more than 30. “It was a three-fold increase in calls for assistance,” Schalk said. “It’s a trying time for all first responders. “The only thing in terms of call volumes that compares to this would be a wind storm, but that’s totally different circumstances, dealing with lines down. “This is the highest percentage of medical calls I’ve experienced.” By Friday, the coroners service was seeing a downward trend in the number of deaths reported. “We are hopeful this trend will continue,” Lapointe said. “Some parts of the province are continuing to experience unusually high temperatures, and it remains important that we all take extra care to avoid the dangerous effects of severe heat. Please look out for family, friends and neighbours, particularly those who live alone.” People are encouraged to visit cooling centres, malls, libraries and other community spaces with air conditioning.

37,"Jun 30, 2021","Public health experts at the University of B.C. say more needs to be done to implement immediate and long-term measures to mitigate the effects of future heat waves. Dr. Farah Shroffsaid public health isn’t in a silo by itself. It’s directly connected to what humans have done and are doing to the environment. “The health of human beings is intricately related to the health of our ecosystem. That’s a public health truism,” she said. “If we do damage to our ecosystem, we damage our health.” She predicted B.C. will have another extreme heat wave. “There’s no doubt about it,” she said. “We do need to prepare ourselves. We need to prevent it as much as deal with downstream effects.” Shroff said B.C. has been reeling from a number of public health emergencies during the past several years, such as racism and Indigenous genocide in addition to COVID-19 and opioid drug overdoses. Many health professionals were already working seven days a week on COVID-19. “It is enough to burn most of us out,” she said. “The heat wave on top of this is almost the straw that could break the camel’s back.” Shroff is founder and lead ofMaternal and Infant Health Canada, a global public health organization. On July 1, she takes up a post as a fellow at Harvard School of Public Health. Michael Brauer, professor at the school of population and public health at UBC, said there was enough advance notice of the heat wave so the City of Vancouver could implement its extreme heat plan. “This should be yet another wake-up call,” he said. “I hate to keep saying it, but we need to take climate change seriously. For our lifetime, climate change is here.” He said what needs to be done is to allocate more money and resources into everything from the way buildings are constructed to adding more shade trees to city streets. Some changes could be as simple as adjusting business hours so people don’t have to be outside during the heat of the day. “We should be thinking seriously about how we’re building structures and thinking about ways to have natural ventilation and air conditioning and shading,” he said. He said while it may be ironic to suggest using air conditioning since it’s linked to a warming climate, it can save lives in the short term. A UBC study found that 110 people died in the Lower Mainland during a heat wave in 2009. In the following years, the City of Vancouver and the park board developed an extreme heat response plan. On Thursday, June 24, the city announced this year’s plan which included opening eight temporary water fountains and misting stations to augment 200 already in place, pointed to 10 air conditioned community centres and neighbourhood houses where people could go to cool off, and announced it was implementing a hot weather support plan for tenants in non-market housing that included wellness checks. TheSeniors Advocateis calling on anyone who knows of an elderly person living alone in an apartment to connect with them during the current heat wave. Isobel Mackenzie stressed the importance of reaching out to the elderly during the next 72 hours. “Don’t just talk to them,” she said Wednesday. “Go to see them if you can. If you can’t connect with them, call the police. If you are seeing significant confusion, vomiting, get that person to a hospital.” The B.C. Coroner’s Service has said 233 people died between Friday and Monday. In Vancouver, 65 unexpected deaths have been reported in homes during the same period. Mackenzie said for some older people, simple daily activities such as getting up and closing blinds or getting a glass of water can be too much to do, especially if they’re already suffering the effects of dehydration. “What I do know is that of the numbers I have seen, they are sobering to say the least, in terms of the number of people who died unexpectedly over the last 72 hours it would appear related to the heat, predominantly seniors living in apartments alone,” she said. She said people visiting the elderly can also: •Apply a cold cloth to the face, wrists and back of neck. If possible, have them run their wrists under cold water to bring down their body temperature. •Ensure they’re drinking cool liquids and eating, since appetites are often reduced during hot weather. •If you’re a senior or know someone who needs help with groceries, meals or medications, phone 2-1-1 to connect withBetter At Home, a United Way agency that helps older adults to continue living in their own homes. kevingriffin@postmedia.com Start your day with a roundup of B.C.-focused news and opinion delivered straight to your inbox at 7 a.m., Monday to Friday by subscribing to ourSunrise newsletter here.

COVID-19 Symptom Self-Assessment Tool 5:45 p.m. —B.C. residents should still wear masks in indoor public places Henry says the next phase of B.C.’s restart plan is a chance to look ahead and reconnect but also to recognize the challenges various communities have faced over the last year and a half. 3:45 p.m. – B.C. reports 44 new cases, no deaths More than 5 million British Columbians have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine as the province’s case numbers continue to dwindle. Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement Wednesday that 78.5 per cent of all adults in B.C. have received their first dose of vaccine, while 32.8 per cent of all adults, more than 1.4 million people, are now fully vaccinated against the respiratory disease. B.C. health officials reported 44 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, but no new deaths. The pandemic death toll in B.C. remains at 1,754. Fraser Health accounted for the most new cases with 17, while Interior Health has 14, Vancouver Coastal Health 12 and the Island Health region recorded a single infection. There were no new cases in the Northern Health region. Of the 816 active cases, 108 individuals are currently hospitalized, 34 of whom are in intensive care. 1:40 p.m. –Extended hours for liquor stores due to COVID now permanent The extended opening times temporarily granted to B.C. liquor stores are now a permanent option. The provincial government authorized liquor retailers to open as early as 7 a.m. during the COVID-19 pandemic to allow for physical distancing for seniors and those who are immunocompromised. This temporary authorization is set to expire on June 30, but has been permanently extended after feedback from the industry. Liquor retailers can now operate between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily. 1:30 p.m. – COVID-19 cases worsen in Latin America, no end in sight: health agency Cases of COVID-19 may be declining in North America but in most of Latin America and the Caribbean the end to the coronavirus pandemic “remains a distant future,” the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said on Wednesday. While infections in the United States, Canada and Mexico are falling, in Latin America and the Caribbean cases are rising and vaccination is lagging badly. Only one in ten people have been fully vaccinated, which PAHO director Carissa Etienne called “an unacceptable situation.” “While we are seeing some reprieve from the virus in countries in the Northern Hemisphere, for most countries in our region, the end remains a distant future,” she said. The regional health agency discouraged summer holiday travel in the Americas now that movement restrictions are being lifted as more people are vaccinated in the Northern Hemisphere and travel destinations, such as the Caribbean, reopen for tourists. According to a Reuters tally, there have been at least 37,441,000 reported infections and 1,272,000 confirmed deaths caused by COVID-19 in Latin America and the Caribbean so far, one third more than in Asia and Africa combined – Reuters 1:30 p.m. –Dr. Bonnie Henry takes findings ‘with a grain of salt’ in dismissing under-reported B.C. deaths study B.C.’s public health officer has rejected the findings of a study that concluded twice as many people died from COVID-19 in B.C. last year than was reported. Dr. Bonnie Henry said the study, commissioned by The Royal Society of Canada, “should be taken with a grain of salt.” The peer-reviewed report by a group of epidemiologists and science researchers from Moriarty Labs at the University of Toronto estimates there were 1,762 unreported COVID-19 deaths in B.C. between February and December 2020.  B.C.’s official COVID-19 death count is 1,754. The report found “a significant spike in at-home versus hospital deaths in 2020 and anti-body surveillance testing that collectively unmasked the likely broad scope of undetected COVID-19 infections.” Henry dismissed the report’s assumptions and conclusions. “I don’t agree with what that report has come out with. Undoubtedly, there are some deaths that we missed early on. It’s just a function of the testing capacity, but we also know from the work that we have done that the vast majority of deaths that we saw were related to COVID in older age groups and related to the overdose crisis in younger age groups,” said Henry. – Lisa Cordasco 11 a.m. – Fraser Health vaccination clinics return to normal operations With the worst of the heat wave behind us, Fraser Health says temporary measures put in place at some of its COVID-19 immunization and testing clinics are now over. On Saturday, the health region started redirecting patients away from its outdoor clinics to alternate clinics with cooler temperatures for immunization. As of Wednesday morning, Fraser Health says all clinics are now open and have returned to regular hours of operation. Fraser Health says existing appointment times are proceeding as planned and all walk-ins for first dose are welcome. While the temperatures have cooled off, they are still well above normal for this time of year. Fraser Health is reminding people attending the clinics to take precautions to protect themselves, including staying hydrated and wearing sunscreen. 11 a.m. – WHO says Delta variant to dominate The delta variant first reported in India is about 55 per cent more transmissible than the Alpha variant, making it likely to outcompete other strains and predominate in coming months, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, noting 96 countries have reported cases. A number of these countries are attributing surges in infections and hospitalizations to delta, the WHO said in a weekly report. France decided on Wednesday to delay the unwinding of COVID-19 restrictions in a southwestern region of the country, while the government’s leading scientific adviser said a fourth wave of the virus was likely to the emergence of the Delta variant. – Reuters 9 a.m. – Richmond plans to continue mask requirement at city facilities after July 1 The City of Richmond said masks will remain mandatory in city-operated facilities even after July 1 when the province enters Step 3 of its restart plan. Under the plan, mask wearing becomes “recommended” rather than mandatory starting Canada Day. The city, which implemented a mandatory mask requirement in its indoor facilities before the province did, said it will continue to maintain the requirement “for now.” Masks remain required inside common areas of community centres, libraries, arenas, pools, Minoru Centre for Active Living, the Cultural Centre, heritage sites, fire halls, city hall, and the Richmond Olympic Oval. People who are swimming or taking fitness classes will not be required to wear a mask during their activity. Children age 12 and under and people with sensory, cognitive or physical disabilities are exempt, as well as those with health conditions that make them unable to wear a face covering. 9 a.m. – Parq Vancouver casino announces reopening plan Parq Vancouver has announced it will reopen on Thursday, with enhanced health and safety measures, revamped gaming experiences, and the launch of two brand new full-service salons. Parq Vancouver closed its casino floors temporarily last year in March when the pandemic hit. Over the 15-month closure, staff have been preparing for the casino’s safe and responsible relaunch, which takes place in accordance with step three of the official BC’s Restart Plan, the company said on Wednesday. The company said gaming floors have been reconfigured to allow for physical distancing between tables and slot machines, plexiglass barriers have been installed where players and staff interact, gaming touchpoints have been reduced or eliminated where possible, and capacity limits are now in place across Parq’s casino floors, private salons, restaurants and lounge areas. As part of the reopening, Parq will also unveil KOI and Luna, two exclusive, full-service gaming salons. 8:30 a.m. –Health Canada adds warning for rare vaccine side effect Health Canada is advising anyone who suffers from capillary leak syndrome to avoid getting the vaccines developed by AstraZeneca. The syndrome is a rare illness that causes fluid to leak from small blood vessels called capillaries and leads to rapid swelling of limbs and weight gain. Health Canada is updating the warning label on the two AstraZeneca vaccines used in Canada. One patient has been diagnosed with capillary leak syndrome following an AstraZeneca vaccination in Canada. – Canadian Press 8:30 a.m. –PNE announces it will return this summer The Pacific National Exhibition will return this summer. Tickets will go on sale Friday for the smaller than usual yet in-person 2021 PNE Fair. The PNE, which will run Aug. 21 to Sept. 6, will follow COVID-19 safety protocols in line with Step 3 of B.C.’s restart plan. PNE president Shelley Frost said after carefully considering a new way forward in light of increasing vaccination rates and declining COVID-19 case counts, they are “extremely pleased” to welcome visitors to the 2021 PNE Fair. For more information check outwww.pne.ca. Tickets are available atwww.TicketLeader.ca. 5 a.m. –Canada Day to mark step 3 of B.C.’s restart plan, says Premier John Horgan B.C. Premier John Horgan says the province will move forward with step 3 of the provincial restart plan on July 1 as planned. Horgan said there were just 29 new cases of COVID-19 reported on Monday. “We can cheer for our kids, go to a friend’s place for dinner, plan that wedding, go to theatre, go to a concert,” said an upbeat Horgan. Step 3 will see a return to normal indoor and outdoor personal gatherings, fairs and festivals can be held, casinos and nightclubs can reopen and all indoor fitness classes are allowed. There will still be restrictions on the numbers of people allowed in casinos and nightclubs and other public safety measures, however masks will no longer have to be worn in public indoor spaces. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said B.C. is making very encouraging progress in beating the pandemic, with high rates of immunization. She said the provincial state of emergency will be lifted on Wednesday at midnight, however, B.C.’s public health emergency will remain in effect. – David Carrigg 5 a.m. –Tourism sector welcomes Step 3 of B.C.’s restart with ‘guarded optimism’ The launch of Step 3 in B.C.’s COVID restart as of July 1 will open interprovincial tourism for residents, which is a welcome, if limited, development for tourism operators. Visitors to B.C., however, will need to remain mindful that not every community will be ready to welcome tourists, said the provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry. And British Columbians headed to other provinces need to check what self-quarantine rules remain in place in destinations they may be headed to, particularly for people not fully vaccinated, which remains a concerning barrier to industry representatives. “We will be welcoming people from other provinces, preferably vaccinated people,” Henry said, though she isn’t recommending people need to prove vaccination. “We know that most British Columbians are doing the right thing.” “The guidelines will be what we have said all along,” Henry said, which includes being respectful of the places people are visiting and recognizing that increased travel brings increased risk that people coming to B.C. will bring the virus, particularly different strains of COVID 19. -Derrick Penner 12 a.m.  – B.C. reports 29 new cases, no additional deaths British Columbia reported 29 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday. There are currently 876 active COVID-19 cases in the province, including 110 people in hospitalized with the disease, according to a joint statement from Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. Thirty-four people are being treated in intensive care. There were no deaths to report on Tuesday. The provincial death toll from the pandemic remains at 1,754. As of Tuesday, more than 4.9 million British Columbians had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while nearly 1.37 million are fully vaccinated after receiving their second shot. B.C.

Only 4% of Democrats agree A majority of Americans (89 per cent) believe the pandemic situation is improving, but there’s a sharp partisan split on whether the U.S. is out of the woods. In a new Gallup Poll, a majority of Republicans (57 per cent) declared the pandemic finished, but only 4 per cent of Democrats agreed. The web survey, conducted by Gallup between June 14 and 20, asked 4,843 adults from their panel about their perception of the COVID pandemic and its effect on their lives. The data is part of the organization’s continuing Americans’ Views of Pandemic in the U.S. report. The results show that while a record number of Americans saw an improvement in pandemic recovery, only 4 per cent of Democrats thought the crisis had ended, as opposed to a majority of Republicans and 35 per cent of Independents. – Postmedia 11:30 a.m. –Third wave would have killed more people in Canada without vaccines: Tam Canada’s chief public health officer says without vaccines the third wave of COVID-19 in Canada would have been much deadlier. Dr. Theresa Tam says as vaccines began to roll out among the most vulnerable, older populations in Canada, she was “quite struck” by how quickly infections and deaths plummeted in that age group. In January, when the second wave of COVID-19 peaked in Canada, more than 4,000 Canadians over the age of 80 died from it. In April, when the third wave peaked and most Canadians over 80 had at least one dose of vaccine, the number of deaths in that age group fell to 498. Tam is thrilled with the current pace of vaccinations in Canada but says with the Delta variant appearing in more places, immunization targets need to be higher. She says higher vaccination rates among adults are particularly important since children under 12 are not yet eligible for vaccines. – The Canadian Press 10:45 a.m. –Tourism experts calling on Canadians to help recovery A panel of tourism experts is predicting Canadians will be “travel hesitant” this summer, despite the easing of travel restrictions, and it will be years before the travel and accommodation sectors bounce back fully. The CEO of Science World told a panel, hosted by the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, that “the pandemic has resulted in behavioural changes.” “As a result, we can’t just reopen and expect people to return,” said Tracy Redies on Monday. “We have seen in the U.S. where things have reopened, that attendance levels remain low.” Redies said that is why Science World plans to continue to require masks be worn inside its facility until September, despite the expectation that B.C’s public health order on masks will be lifted on July 1. Last year, the tourism industry in B.C. generated $7 billion in revenues, down from $21.5 billion in 2019. Workers in the hospitality and accommodation sectors suffered the highest number of jobs lost, with a third of those workers, about 40,000, remaining unemployed. The managing director of sales, planning and effectiveness for Air Canada, Timothy Liu, told the panel any recovery will be slow. “Summer is concerning for us, with ongoing border restrictions and quarantine requirements,” said Liu. “We’d like government leaders to get the message out that it is safe to travel.” – Lisa Cordasco 8 a.m. – Moderna’s shot productes antibodies against Delta variant Moderna Inc. said its vaccine produced protective antibodies against the Delta variant spreading in Canada and many other parts of the world. Moderna researchers tested blood samples from eight people for antibodies against versions of the spike protein from different coronavirus variants, including delta, which emerged in India. The vaccine “produced neutralizing titers against all variants tested,” the company said in a statement. – Bloomberg 3 a.m. –Researchers estimate thousands more died of COVID-19 outside long-term care Canada may have undercounted more than 5,700 COVID-19 deaths during the first 10 months of the pandemic — and even more since then, says a new report from the Royal Society of Canada. More than 26,000 people have died from COVID-19, so far, according to official data from the Public Health Agency of Canada. By Nov. 14, 2020, the country had recorded 11,009 deaths. But the newly released study, which examined data between Feb. 1, 2020 and Nov. 28, 2020, found evidence that Canada has vastly undercounted COVID deaths. The report, completed by a team of five researchers, found that if Canada continued to miscount fatalities past last November “the pandemic mortality burden may be two times higher than reported.” Based on previous estimates, Canada is believed to have experienced 80 per cent of its COVID-19 deaths among people in long-term care, the report says. This is roughly double the average of 40 per cent among equivalent countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. However the report, released Tuesday morning, suggests that these uncounted deaths occurred primarily in Canadians older than 45 who were not living in long-term care homes. The team found that up to two-thirds of deaths that occurred outside of long-term care homes are missing from Canada’s total. — National Post 12 a.m. –Pandemic fizzles in B.C. as more restrictions set to be lifted July 1 The COVID-19 pandemic is fizzling out in B.C. as the provincial health officer prepares to lift more restrictions on Canada Day — giving people a choice of whether to wear a mask in public indoor settings. “Transmission has decreased. And we see particularly in the Lower Mainland where we have had high rates of cases for many, many months, they have now dropped dramatically,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry , as she reported 145 new cases over the past three days – including just 38 on Sunday. Henry highlighted that the crucial disease reproductive rate has continued to fall below one across the province. “What we can see is we now have a sustained low reproductive rate. That means that for most people who are infected, they are not passing this virus on to anybody else. That’s how the pandemic will fizzle out over time.” — David Carrigg B.C.

Ministry of Health data shows that since Dec. 2020 11,043,787 doses of Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Fifty four per cent of B.C.’s adult population has had three doses of vaccine and 84.9 per cent of all people aged five and over have received at least one dose. B.C. recorded five COVID-19 deaths over the past day and there are 54 active outbreaks in health-care facilities. The number of people in hospital either because of COVID-19 or with COVID-19 fell slightly to 867, with 138 of those in intensive care. It is estimated 40 per cent of COVID-19 hospital cases are people who are in hospital because they have COVID-19. Exact numbers breaking down those in hospital because of COVID or with COVID are not provided. The government is no longer releasing active case data because it is not accurate. This is because daily numbers are also no longer accurate because B.C. has reduced the number of PCR tests performed to about 10,000 a day. The testing capacity is 20,000 per day. A new Ipsos poll found that 56 per cent of B.C. respondents with both their first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine don’t plan to get their booster immediately. The remainder say they are undecided or have chosen not to receive a booster at all. “It’s concerning that some people are choosing to wait or not get it at all. After six months, their existing immunization doesn’t provide as much protection as before, as their immunity from the second dose wanes,” said Jamie Wigston, president of the BC Pharmacy Associationwhich commissioned the poll. Conducted between Jan. 28 and Feb. 3, the poll also found that 41 per cent of respondents felt that two doses was adequate protection, while 33 per cent worried about potential long-term effects and 27 per cent just wanted to move on with life. Those over the age of 55 were more likely to have had a booster, with 78 per cent saying they had received their third shot. Meanwhile, just 27 per cent of those between the ages of 18 and 34 and 40 per cent of those 35 to 54 had gotten their booster. About 1,000 community pharmacies are set up to provide the COVID-19 vaccine across B.C. The poll was conducted online and included 801 British Columbians who are members of the Ipsos I-Say Panel. The data was weighted by region, age, gender and education to reflect B.C.’s population. A poll with this sample size would carry a margin of error of +/- 1.0 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. –Stephanie Ip All health care professionals in British Columbia must be vaccinated by March 24 — or be deregistered by their licensing body. On Wednesday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry made good on a notice given to health professionals in October 2021 stating that she was finalizing — in consultation with all health professional colleges — an order that requires all regulated health professionals to be vaccinated by March 24, 2022, to work in their occupation in B.C. In a prepared statement, Henry said “the purpose of this provincial health officer order is to protect patients from being infected with (COVID-19) by unvaccinated health professionals, as well as to minimize the number of people being hospitalized or dying because of the virus. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says restrictions in her Gatherings and Events public health order could be lifted when the order expires on Feb. 16. B.C. has four active public health orders in place that control activities in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The Gatherings and Events order is the only one that has a set expiry date. Henry said an announcement would be made on Feb. 15. B.C.’s Face Coverings order does not have an expiry date. The Food and Liquor Serving Premises order also does not have an expiry date. Henry said she wants to start talking less about the pandemic, and more about how to manage risk. She said surveillance reports would also be changed, including the removal of active cases data. Active case numbers are no longer accurate due to the limited testing in the province. Kid Carson and Z95.3 FM have parted ways after the radio host went on a conspiracy-laced tirade about vaccine mandates on his Wednesday morning show, during which Carson said the media are manipulating the public about the pandemic and claimed a “digital ID” would control children’s lives. Carson admitted during the segment he had been having a hard time at the station because he felt he was on tenterhooks with his bosses, ever since he went public six months ago with his opposition to vaccine passports. He said he felt he was unable to speak his mind about what he sees as the politicization of the pandemic and a lack of respect for alternative views around vaccine mandates. Carson claimed there is “a lot of manipulation taking place” in the media aimed at demonizing movements like the anti-mandate truck convoy. The federal government sent nearly $12 million in Canada Emergency Response Benefit payments to people with foreign addresses in the first seven months of the pandemic. Documents tabled in the House of Commons last week following questions from Conservative MP Jamie Schmale reveal that 1,610 people received the pandemic financial aid benefit despite applying with a mailing address outside of Canada. Because they were able to apply for multiple months in a row, the government says it paid them a total of $11.9 million by the time the program was put to bed and replaced by different benefits in September 2020. That, despite eligibility requirements for the federal government’s now-defunct $2,000-per-month CERB program clearly stating that “the benefit was available to workers residing in Canada who were at least 15 years old.” Read the full story here. —Christopher Nardi Ontario has no immediate plans to end its mask mandate and COVID-19 vaccine certificate system, the province’s health minister said Wednesday as she announced details of a plan to distribute free rapid tests at grocery stores and pharmacies. Christine Elliott said Ontario won’t be following the lead of other provinces like Alberta and Saskatchewan, which started lifting vaccine passport rules this week and plan to end masking requirements in the near future. Elliott said Ontario intends to keep those measures for while longer, though she didn’t say exactly when they would lift. “We have no plans currently to drop the passport vaccination situation or masking. We believe that masking is going to be important for some time to come,” Elliott said at a news conference in Kitchener, Ont., adding that the province is following advice from the chief medical officer and other expert advisers. —The Canadian Press Here are a number of information and landing pages for COVID-19 from various health and government agencies. •B.C.

41,,"Good Samaritans stepped in to help several Vancouver seniors after the sweltering heat aggravated their health problems, paying to book them into a hotel for two days. But one of the seniors says many more are struggling in her building, which lacks functioning air conditioning. Some are using fans and tying ice packs to their heads, but there isn’t much relief, said Catherine Stafford, who lives at Linden Tree Place, a four-storey residence in Kitsilano for about 30 low income seniors and people with spinal cord injuries. “The real issue is the fact that the cooling system in the hallway is blowing hot air and it can’t be turned off,” said Stafford. “I can feel the stress on my heart. It feels heavy and it’s kind of painful and hard to breathe,” she said. After she posted “a comment on someone else’s comment” on Facebook, two strangers reached out online and paid for Stafford and two other Linden Tree residents, who have asthma, to stay in a hotel room on Sunday and Monday. One of them “made the reservation to start, and it was all paid for by (people in) the community,” said Stafford. “They just took it over.” The hotel rooms were arranged by Kits resident Hadani Ditmars and paid for by a friend of hers who is a local philanthropist. “It’s like 50 C in our hallway and it’s contributing to the heat in our apartments. There’s quite a few disabled people in this building with wheelchairs and a lot of people have health issues like me.” She’s anticipating that when she returns to Linden on Tuesday, she “will be sleeping in my car because it’s not going to cool down that much to be able to sleep in my apartment.” “The suggestion by the property manager was to put a wet cloth over the vents in the hallway,” said Stafford. “That didn’t work because it just dried in two seconds.” She added that few residents have portable air conditioners because they can’t afford them. After many calls to the building manager, she said, a small common room with air conditioning was opened. However, there is only room for a few chairs. On Monday, residents at two other nearby independent living homes for seniors facing a similar situation were informed that a “cooling station” would be open. An e-mail from building managers for Red Oak Place at Kitsilano Neighbourhood House said that “the way the building is designed, the air conditioning can only cool common areas.” That means, it said, the air supply to common areas is 19C, but as people leave windows and doors open to catch a breeze, it had little effect. “It’s like trying to cool down the car. One needs to close windows and turn on a/c.” One resident, who declined to be named because she was worried about ‘falling out’ with building managers, said residents at the three homes include advocates who are knowledgeable and capable about managing properties and voicing their concerns. Some helped to create many of the innovative housing alternatives that were developed in the 1970s, she said. Seniors, she said, are “dismissed in general” but for this group to be treated that way, “wow.” jlee-young@postmedia.com"
42,"Jun 28, 2021","The residents ofLyttonare used to coping with hot temperatures during the summer. With records for the hottest temperature ever recorded in Canada on Sunday, at 46.6 C, and on Monday hitting 47.9 C, it’s been extreme even for the 250 people who live in Lytton and the 3,000 in the immediate region. The village of Lytton and theLytton First Nationopened air-conditioned cooling centres for people who need it, said Mayor Jan Polderman. “The residents here are used to high temperatures,” Polderman told Postmedia Monday. “In summer, they’re around 38 and 39 at times. That’s just plain hot at that point.” Lytton is 260 km northeast of Vancouver on the Trans-Canada Highway. Located at the juncture of Thompson and Fraser rivers, it’s on the traditional territory of theNlaka’pamuxwho call the spot Camchin, which means river meeting. “When it’s 46 degrees,” Polderman said, “it’s best just to stay in the shade and not do too much. People, they arrange their days so they’re not out from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.” He said one of the local traditions to beat the heat is for people to get out of town and drive up to the cooler air of nearby Pasulko and Botanie lakes, located at an elevation of about 1,200 metres. Denise O’Connor, manager of theVisitor Information Centre, said Lytton often gets up to around 40 C every summer — but not usually until July and August. She agreed, however, that the current heat wave is unusual. “Yesterday was hot,” she said of the record-breaking day. “I like to think of us as Canada’s hot spot.” When she’s back home, O’Connor looks forward to the point in the day when the sun dips beneath the mountains. That’s when it starts to cool and she can go outside on the deck. She doesn’t have to worry about mosquitoes because she says there aren’t any in Lytton. “I’m looking at the forecast and I can’t wait until Friday when it’s 33,” she said. “It’ll be nice and cool then.” Environment Canada warns the torrid heat wave that has settled over much of Western Canada won’t lift for days, although parts of British Columbia and Yukon could see some relief sooner. Heat warnings were posted across B.C. and Alberta, large parts of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and a section of Yukon on Monday as the weather office forecasts temperatures reaching 40 C in some areas. Kamloops registered a daily high of 44.7 C on Monday, Squamish peaked at 42.6 and Victoria hit 38.7 C. In the Lower Mainland, Vancouver hit 32.3 C while Abbotsford reached 42.2 C. Across the province, 51 of 128 weather stations reported a daily record on Monday. Environment Canadawarns the “prolonged, dangerous and historic heat wave” could ease as early as Tuesday on B.C.’s south coast and in Yukon, but won’t relent until mid-week or early next week elsewhere. Forecasters said humid conditions could make it feel close to 50 C in B.C.’s Fraser Valley, where area raspberry growers say any cooling by Tuesday may come too late for their heat-ravaged crops. One farm posted on social media that its season is likely over before a single berry has been picked. Forestry experts are hoping clear, blue skies hold over Western Canada as unprecedented hot weather pushes wildfire risks to levels just as record-breaking. “The silver lining to this current heat wave thus far is that it’s so hot and it’s such a stable atmosphere that it’s suppressing lightning activity,” University of Alberta wildfire scientist Mike Flannigan said Monday. “If there’s no ignition, we don’t have a problem.” That’s a big if. “Temperatures are in uncharted territory,” said Yan Boulanger, a forest ecologist for Natural Resources Canada. “Those indices for forest fire are very, very high right now.” Just a couple weeks ago, the department’s wildfire risk maps showed most of Western Canada to be at average or even below-average risk. No longer. “I would say they are extremely extreme right now,” Boulanger said. So far, wildfires haven’t been a major problem. Although 19 fires have sprung up in B.C. over the last two days, most remain under five hectares in size. Mike Danks, team leader of North Shore Rescue, said hikes should be postponed until the temperature lowers considerably. “My recommendation is that you do something else,” he said. “This is not the day to be doing more of an extreme hike in the backcountry because there’s very little shelter for you once you’re out there, from the sun, and conditions are changing rapidly.” Danks said snow is thawing quickly and that creates unstable conditions. “I really caution people against doing anything that’s more than a light hike, like going down to the rivers to get some cooling,” he said. “Even when conditions are more normal, people need to be very hydrated prior to going on a hike. It’s not enough just to bring a couple of litres of water with you on a hike.” Early last week, even before temperatures began to soar, crews rescued someone who passed out on the trails of Mount Hanover, Danks said, adding the person had ventured out without enough food and water. Crews then responded to another call at Crown Mountain, where a hiker had vomited and was unable to move, he said. “We’re seeing temperatures in the upper 30s and into the 40s today, which is extreme. If you factor in the amount of effort that you’re going to have to put in to travel in these conditions and temperatures, it’s just not worth the risk. And it’s going to be the same for our members conducting a rescue.” — With files from The Canadian Press kevingriffin@postmedia.com Start your day with a roundup of B.C.-focused news and opinion delivered straight to your inbox at 7 a.m., Monday to Friday by subscribing to ourSunrise newsletter here.

COVID-19 Symptom Self-Assessment Tool MONDAY 3 p.m. – B.C. on track for step 3 of restart plan July 1 as COVID-19 transmission plunges Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says the rate of transmission of COVID-19 in B.C. has dropped off dramatically – paving the way for step 3 of the restart plan to begin July 1. Henry reported just 38 new cases on Sunday, plus 50 on Saturday and 57 on Friday. She said there are now fewer than 1,000 active cases of the disease (930) of which 107 are being treated in hospital including 37 in intensive care. Health authorities administered 427,000 doses of vaccine in the past week. There has been 4,886,709 doses administered so far, including 1,320,194 that are second doses. Henry said the Delta variant that originated in India now accounts for around 12 per cent of cases being detected. 2:45 p.m. – VCH cancels postpones appointments at some clinics Vancouver Coastal Health is postponing all appointments booked today starting at 1 p.m. at both the West End Community Centre and Vancouver Community College due to the heat wave. Anyone who had an appointment at either of those two clinics will receive an alert through the provincial booking system informing them that their appointment has been cancelled. They can then rebook at any VCH clinic, either through the online system or by calling 1-833-838-2323. Meanwhile, anyone with an appointment at the ICBC vaccination clinic is being diverted to the West Vancouver Community College Centre. 2:45 p.m. –B.C. employers shift from COVID-19 safety plans to prevention as communicable disease WorkSafeBC has issued guidelines for employers on transitioning from safety measures around COVID-19 to preventing the illness as a communicable disease. The change is in line with the next phase of the province’s reopening plan, expected to kick in on Thursday. WorkSafeBC is putting provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry’s recent advice into practice by asking employers to ensure that fundamental practices like handwashing and personal hygiene are followed before the regular season of respiratory illness begins in the fall. Employers will be required to provide appropriate ventilation and encourage employees to stay home when they are sick. Henry has also said employers must be prepared to implement or maintain additional measures when the risk of communicable disease including influenza is elevated in their region or the workplace. Al Johnson, WorkSafeBC’s head of prevention services, says the agency is expecting more direction on whether masks should continue to be worn as employers slowly shift to taking on new responsibilities over the coming weeks and months. “We’re not expecting employers to immediately, on the 1st of July, to take away all of the precautions and safeguards that they were employing for the last 15 months, but to work with their workers and to transition away from those,” Johnson says. He says workers have the right to refuse unsafe work, the same as any time they don’t feel they are being adequately protected. Johnson says prevention officers will continue to do inspections as they have done for COVID-19 plans, but will now be shifting to more consultation with employers and workers. – The Canadian Press 10:45 a.m. – Canada has 10 million people fully vaccinated Canada crossed a milestone this weekend of having 10 million people fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Ontario reported today it had given second doses to more than 160,000 people Sunday, pushing the number of fully vaccinated people in the country to 10.14 million — or more than 30 per cent of eligible Canadians at least 12 years old. Canada’s fully vaccinated population is increasing quickly, with more than three million people vaccinated in the last week alone. At the current pace, Canada could reach 50 per cent fully vaccinated in about two weeks. – The Canadian Press 8 a.m. –Mixing vaccines produces better immune responses: Oxford A mixed schedule of vaccines where a shot of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is given four weeks after a AstraZeneca shot will produce better immune responses than giving another dose of the AstraZeneca shot, an Oxford study said on Monday. The study, called Com-COV, compared mixed two-dose schedules of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, and found that in any combination, they produced high concentrations of antibodies against the coronavirus spike protein. The data provides support for the decision of some European countries that have started offering alternatives to AstraZeneca as a second shot after the vaccine was linked to rare blood clots. Matthew Snape, the Oxford professor behind the trial, said that the findings could be used to give flexibility to vaccine rollouts, but was not large enough to recommend a broader shift away from clinically approved schedules on its own. “It’s certainly encouraging that these antibody and T-cell responses look good with the mixed schedules, but I think your default has to stay, unless there’s a very good reason otherwise, to what is proven to work,” he told reporters. The highest antibody response was seen in people receiving two doses of Pfizer vaccine, with both mixed schedules producing better responses than two doses of AstraZeneca vaccine. An AstraZeneca shot followed by Pfizer produced the best T-cell responses, and also a higher antibody response than Pfizer followed by AstraZeneca. The results were for combinations of vaccines given at four week intervals to 830 participants. – Reuters 8 a.m. – Japan steps up pre-Olympic COVID response after two positives Japan is boosting its efforts to avoid a COVID-19 outbreak by increasing health controls at airports as athletes from around the world arrive for the Olympics and Paralympics this summer. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga vowed to make changes after two members of the nine-person contingent from Uganda tested positive. One member tested positive at the Narita International Airport in Tokyo, the other three days later at their training site in Izumisano, about a seven-hour drive from Tokyo. Both were discovered to have the Delta variant, thought to be more highly transmissible than the original. The team members have been quarantined and seven locals who came in close contact with them are self-isolating. All members of the team received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine before entering Japan, Kyodo News reported. Among the changes promised in response are a requirement of seven days of daily tests for athletes and others departing from a region that has had exposure to the Delta variant (up from four days) and again for up to 14 days after entry into the country. The Tokyo Games, which were postponed from last year because of the pandemic, are set to begin July 23. – Reuters 6:45 a.m. –Mass clinic in Toronto sets record with 26,000 vaccinations A clinic at Toronto’s Scotiabank Arena administered 26,771 doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on Sunday. “The total COVID-19 vaccine doses administered (Sunday) are believed to be a new world record for most one-day COVID-19 vaccinations given at a single clinic,” wrote the City of Toronto in a news release. Other sports venues including London Stadium and Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles have been used for mass vaccinations. The Texas Motor Speedway recorded more than 17,000 shots on one day in April — an event that Toronto officials cited as a previous record for a clinic in North America, and a number they intended to beat. – Bloomberg 6:15 a.m. –Total COVID-19 vaccine deliveries to top 50 million doses by week’s end Canada should have enough COVID-19 vaccine by the end of this week to fully inoculate three-quarters of all Canadians over the age of 12. Brig. Gen. Krista Brodie, the military commander managing national vaccine delivery logistics for the Public Health Agency of Canada, says Pfizer-BioNTech is to send more than 2.4 million doses this week and Moderna about 1.4 million. Those shipments will push Canada’s total vaccine deliveries above 50 million doses to date, enough to administer two shots to 75 per cent of eligible residents. Another 18 million doses are expected in July, enough to fully vaccinate all 33.2 million Canadians over the age of 12. Children under that threshold won’t be able to get immunized until trials testing the vaccines on younger children are completed later this summer or in the fall. As of Sunday, more than 25.5 million residents had received at least one dose, and Canada is on the verge of hitting 10 million people fully vaccinated. – Canadian Press 6:15 a.m. –Nearly 30 per cent of respondents broke COVID-19 restrictions: Canada-wide survey Almost 30 per cent of respondents in a newly released Canada-wide survey admitted to breaking COVID-19 rules — and felt justified doing so. The survey by the Canadian Hub for Applied and Social Research at the University of Saskatchewan was done between June 1 and June 14. It asked 1,000 people about how closely they stuck to public health orders and where they were getting their information about the pandemic. Some 29 per cent said they broke at least one COVID-19 restriction. The most common transgressions were around gathering limits and wearing masks. But the survey also found that respondents were generally diligent about following isolation requirements and gave honest responses to COVID-19 screening questions. – Canadian Press 6:15 a.m. –AstraZeneca vaccine produces strong immune response from booster shot: U.K. study A third shot of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine produces a strong immune response, researchers said on Monday, adding there was not yet evidence that such shots were needed, especially given shortages in some countries. The Oxford University study found that a third dose of the vaccine increases antibody and T-cell immune responses, while the second dose can be delayed up to 45 weeks and also lead to an enhanced immune response. The British government has said it is looking at plans for an autumn vaccine booster campaign, with three-fifths of adults already having received both doses of a COVID vaccine. Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said that evidence that the vaccine protects against current variants for a sustained period of time meant that such a booster may not be needed. – Reuters 6 a.m. –Pay inequities pushed women out of the workforce during pandemic Nearly 350,000 Canadian women who lost their jobs during the pandemic hadn’t returned to work as of February 2021, highlighting existing gender inequalities and pushing women’s employment to a two decade low. Researchers at SFU and the University of Saskatchewan looked at the economic impact of COVID-19 on women workers and the repercussions for gender equality in the workforce. They found that women lost a disproportionate number of jobs during the pandemic, partly as a result of being overrepresented in hardest hit sectors, such as retail and restaurants and also because of significant gaps in pay between men and women. According to the report’s authors, women made up 48 per cent of Canada’s workforce in March 2020, but sustained 58 per cent of pandemic job losses. According to the study, women consistently lost a disproportionate number of jobs in every job category outside of heath care and social assistance. Worst hit was retail, where women make up 50 per cent of employees, yet lost 91 per cent of the jobs. – Nathan Griffiths SUNDAY 3 p.m. –International students navigate numerous barriers as they look to begin fall classes International students coming to Canada this year as COVID-19 cases rise and fall in various parts of the world face numerous barriers such as visa backlogs, lack of vaccinations, quarantine measures and fewer available flights. A spokeswoman for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said the department has continued to accept and process study permit applications throughout the pandemic. It updated its website to show that complete study permit applications submitted for the fall 2021 semester by May 15 would be processed by Aug. 6. However, some applications may take longer because they are incomplete, said Nancy Caron in a statement. “Against the backdrop of the global pandemic and its related challenges, we wanted to provide a target date for those planning to begin their studies in the fall,” she said. The department issued nearly 100,000 study permits in the first four months of 2021, up from about 66,000 during the same period last year and about 96,000 from January to April of 2019, she said. 12 p.m. –B.C. casinos ready to reopen As B.C. continues lifting COVID-19 restrictions, casinos and nightclubs are some of the last spaces that have remained totally shuttered. The province’s hospitality industry hopes that will change this week, as the province looks ready to move to the third step of its restart plan on July 1. While it sounds like Vancouver’s nightclub sector is looking at a more gradual reopening, casino operators are eager to get going again as soon as provincial authorities give the go-ahead. “It won’t be official until the provincial government announces it, but at this point, we are gearing up and — to use a casino term — we are all in, in terms of getting ready for July 1,” said Chuck Keeling, executive vice president at Great Canadian Canadian Casinos. Keeling said Great Canadian, which operates nine casinos in B.C. including Vancouver’s Hastings Park and the River Rock in Richmond, has already called back hundreds of employees who were put out of work in March 2020 when casinos closed down in the first wave of the COVID-19. – Dan Fumano B.C.

General manager Marc Bergevin announced Sunday that Armia was being held from practice and would not travel with the team to Tampa afterward. It was not clear whether he had tested positive or been deemed a close contact. Armia, 28, was also in the protocol in March. He had seven goals and seven assists in 41 regular-season games and has five goals and three assists in 17 playoff appearances this season. Interim head coach Dominique Ducharme, who has been sidelined since a positive COVID test on June 18, is also out, though he expects to return to the bench for Game 3 in Montreal on Friday. — The Canadian Press 8:15 a.m. – Dr. Theresa Tam now on fully vaccinated list Canada’s chief public health officer has joined the ranks of the fully vaccinated. Dr. Theresa Tam is also among the Canadians mixing two different vaccines. She received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on April 13 in Ottawa, and tweeted that she was “thrilled” to get her second dose on Saturday using the shot from Moderna. Tam thanked all Canadians for rolling up their sleeves for first and second shots, saying the collective effort to seek protection from COVID-19 is making a difference. — The Canadian Press 8 a.m. – New UK health secretary says priority Is getting country back to normal The U.K.’s new health chief Sajid Javid said his top priority is ending the pandemic amid a surge in virus cases that’s delayed the easing of restrictions. Javid was named to the post Saturday by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The latest official figures show new coronavirus cases in the U.K. have climbed to their highest level since early February, with 18,270 new infections reported Saturday. – Bloomberg SATURDAY 11 a.m. – Fraser Health rebooking vaccines dues to extreme heat wave Due to the extreme heat wave that is affecting Abbotsford and other areas of B.C., Fraser Health is rebooking COVID-19 vaccine appointments at the Abbotsford Ag-Rec Centre that were scheduled for 1 p.m. or later today. The heat wave is causing elevated internal temperatures in the clinic and, as a result, Fraser Health says it made the decision to rebook these appointments to protect the health and safety of staff and clients. People who have been affected by this temporary measure are asked to call 1-833-838-2323 to rebook their appointment. Alternatively, people may walk-in to another location. 5 a.m. –The implications of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy Most British Columbians are rolling up their sleeves and lining up to get a COVID-19 vaccine in the pursuit of a two-dose summer, but Michael is determined not to be one of them. The 25-year-old East Vancouver man knows COVID is very real: He is afraid to get the virus, terrified of passing it on to his parents, and vigilant about wearing a mask and face shield whenever he’s out in public. But when he became eligible for the vaccine, he said thanks, but no thanks. “I don’t know what’s in the vaccine,” Michael told Postmedia. “I want to live a natural life. If I get sick, I get sick. Is your body going to be dependent on these shots all the time?” Michael, who did not want his full name published for fear of a backlash, is worried about the long-term side effects of the vaccines, as well as the speed at which they were developed. He’s read things, too — about how people “get magnetic” and that the virus came from a lab leak — and doesn’t know what to believe. Everyone in his family is vaccinated, and they have been pressuring him to get the jab. There’s also societal pressure. Once he tells people he’s not vaccinated, he says, “They look at me different.” As of Friday, B.C. has vaccinated 76.2 per cent of its eligible population — putting it on track for the next phase of the province’s reopening plan on July 1. But about five to 10 per cent of adult Canadians have told pollsters they do not plan to get vaccinated. A recent survey by Leger for Postmedia found 10 per cent of British Columbians are not vaccinated, with five per cent on the fence, and five per cent saying they won’t get the vaccine. The top reason why someone hasn’t been vaccinated? Concerns about side effects (72 per cent). Other reasons include not believing the vaccines work (39 per cent); not worried about contracting COVID-19 (22 per cent); and hoping B.C. reaches herd immunity and they won’t have to take it (21 per cent). Only six per cent said they do not believe COVID-19 is real. -Cheryl Chan 12 a.m. –72 new cases, two deaths as some clinics moved due to heat wave On Friday, B.C. reported 72 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total of active cases to 1,096. Of these, 108 are in hospital, with 37 patients in intensive care. There were two new deaths, bringing the provincial death total to 1,749. Meanwhile, on the vaccination front, B.C. is slowly inching its way to an 80 per cent vaccination rate. About 77 per cent of all adults in B.C. and 76 per cent of those 12 and older have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Many pop-up clinics have been moved to cooler, indoor locations due to extreme hot temperatures forecast for this weekend throughout the province. B.C.

Fraser Health says four patients have tested positive for COVID-19. The outbreak is limited to one unit, which is temporarily closed to admissions. Fraser Health says it has notified all patients in the unit and their families about the outbreak. 7 a.m. –B.C. doctors urge reluctant patients to get the vaccine Doctors of B.C. has been engaged in a vaccine campaign calledThis is our Shot, BC,along with theSouth Asian COVID task force, which includes encouraging health care providers to talk to patients about whether they have been vaccinated. As part of that campaign, the organizations have posted videoson YouTube,and provided printable fact sheets and posters for doctors to use in their clinics. Dr Matthew Chow, president of Doctors of B.C., said this week that their campaign is going extraordinarily well. “The uptake of vaccines in B.C. is amongst the highest in all jurisdictions in the world. We are seeing more than 75 per cent of people aged 12 plus having received at least one dose, so these are extraordinary numbers,” he said. He said of course there are some folks who are still reluctant to get the vaccine, and the reason for that is mostly because of misinformation circulating on social media. So physicians and other health providers are working to reach out to their patients to help fight the confusion, by discussing the science behind the vaccines, and the risks associated with not getting one. Chow said it’s natural for patients to have safety concerns. He combats the reluctance by showing his patients the data and talking about the harm that COVID-19 can cause to them and their loved ones.

A joint statement from provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix says the increasing vaccine numbers allow for the gradual and safe reopening of the province with the lifting of more restrictions. It says more than 4.5 million doses of vaccine have been delivered in total and, of those, slightly over a million were second shots. There are 87 new COVID-19 cases across B.C., with no new cases in the Northern Health region and three new cases on Vancouver Island. There has been one new death, bringing the total number of COVID-19 deaths to 1,744 people. There are two new health-care outbreaks at Minoru Residence and Hollyburn House, both in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. The statement says all vaccines available in B.C., including Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca, are safe and effective and they significantly reduce the number of people getting seriously ill with COVID-19. -The Canadian Press 5 a.m. –Canada will lift more border restrictions in the weeks to come: Trudeau Canada will further relax border restrictions in the weeks to come as long as the science supports such a move, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday, suggesting Ottawa would move more quickly than initially announced. Trudeau, under pressure to allow non-essential travel from the United States, was more categorical than he had been on Tuesday, when he said announcements on border relaxation measures would come in the weeks ahead. “I know people want to reopen (the border). But I know these people are also really afraid that we will have to pull back and reimpose restrictions if we open too quickly,” he told French-language broadcaster Radio-Canada. Pressed for a specific timetable as to when the restrictions would be eased, Trudeau replied: “This will happen in weeks – it won’t be months, we’re talking about weeks – but it will take a few more weeks.” Canada said on Monday it would waive quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated citizens on July 5 but made clear it would be months before U.S. and other foreign travelers could enter the country. Trudeau said authorities were looking at vaccination rates, the spread of variants of concern and how the rest of the world was dealing with COVID-19. Canada and the United States first banned non-essential travel in March 2020 as a part of the effort to fight COVID-19. The restrictions, which exclude trade in goods, are now due to expire on July 21, 2021. -Reuters 5 a.m. –Popularity of camper vans on rise during COVID-19 pandemic With travel restrictions easing across Canada, camper-van rentals are growing in popularity as a vacation option during COVID-19. While the Canada-U.S. border remains closed, Canadians are already booking trips to local campsites. “The traffic has certainly increased. We are seeing a very full June and July in Alberta and B.C. We’re about 85 per cent sold-out in Alberta until the end of September and 70 per cent sold-out from July to the end of September in B.C.,” Dave Wald, managing partner of Karma Campervans, said. “I’m expecting that the rest of the summer will fill up until the fall again just like last year because people have gotten a bit of cabin fever, they need to scratch that travel itch. They may not necessarily be ready to get on the airplane, but they’re certainly ready to get into a vehicle, and explore their provinces.” -Pratyush Dayal 12 a.m. – 87 new cases and one death reported in B.C B.C. reported 87 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, and one more related death. Of the new cases, 13 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 30 are in the Fraser Health region, three are in the Island Health region and 41 are in the Interior Health region.

Here’s what you should know British Columbians eager to book family vacations to Hawaii or Disneyland in the U.S. after travel restrictions ease might want to hold off until November. Extra costs for COVID-19 tests, queues and delays, travelling with kids who aren’t vaccinated, and the uncertainty of when the Canada-U.S. border will reopen to non-essential travel could cause headaches. Travel expert Claire Newell, president of Travel Best Bets, recommends booking your journey to the States after November, or next year, and going through a travel agent so that you can get insurance if you need to cancel your trip. Canada announced earlier this week that starting on the night of July 5, fully vaccinated travellers will not be required to undergo a three-day hotel quarantine upon arrival, provided they have a plan for self-quarantine at home while awaiting results of a mandatory COVID test on arrival. They will also have to show proof of vaccination by being registered on the ArriveCAN app. “That headline had a lot of people thinking, ‘Wow, I can travel now,’ but it was a baby step forward,” said Newell. Many are starting to book trips but for later in the year, and into 2022, she added. And it’s still unknown when the border restrictions will lift. As it stands now, it won’t be until after July 21. The feds continue to “strongly advise” that Canadians avoid non-essential travel outside of the country. “So at this point you don’t want to be booking for July 6.

Dr. Brendan Hanley says Yukon was put on a pedestal over the pas few months with no active cases and a high vaccination rate, but all eyes are on the territory now to see how it deals with a “significant” outbreak. Hanley says over the past 14 days, there have been more cases in Yukon than in the first 14 months of the pandemic. Of the 144 cases in the latest outbreak, he says 122 of them were among unvaccinated people ranging in age from one to 90 years old. Hanley says the outbreak is likely linked to one case introduced around Victoria Day and it spread with gatherings in June, although it will be difficult to know when and who was the first case. He says the new infections show that a 72 per cent vaccination rate is not enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and at least 80 per cent of the population should receive their shots. — Canadian Press 2 p.m. –COVID-19: Planning a family vacation to U.S. when border reopens?

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory groups, meeting to discuss reported cases of the heart condition after vaccination, found the risk in adolescents and young adults is likely linked to the vaccines, but that the benefits of the shots appeared to clearly outweigh the risk. Health regulators in several countries have been investigating whether the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots using new mRNA technology present a risk and, if so, how serious. The CDC said that patients with heart inflammation following vaccination generally recover from the symptoms and do well. The U.S. Department of Health And Human Services, joined by leading U.S. doctors groups and public health officials, put out a statement underscoring that the vaccines are safe and effective and that the heart side effect is “extremely rare.” “We strongly encourage everyone age 12 and older who are eligible to receive the vaccine under Emergency Use Authorization to get vaccinated,” it said. — Reuters 12 p.m. –B.C. teams up with UCL expert to develop long-term economic plan for post pandemic era B.C. is teaming up with a professor from University College London to develop a long-term economic plan for the post-pandemic era. Mariana Mazzucato and her team at UCL’s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose will advise the B.C. government as it develops a plan to build a sustainable, inclusive and innovative economy, the government announced Wednesday. The government will seek input from B.C. business groups, labour, Indigenous Nations, post-secondary institutions, not-for-profit organizations, local governments and the public. Jobs Minister Ravi Kahlon these sessions will involve people representing multiple sectors so they can come together to share ideas about the future of B.C.’s economy. “The pandemic challenged B.C. in ways we never imagined. It brought out the very best in us as British Columbians, but it also shined a light on the historic gaps we see in our province,” said Kahlon, in a statement. 10:20 a.m. –AstraZeneca, Pfizer vaccines effective against Delta COVID-19 variants: Study COVID-19 vaccines made by AstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech alliance remain broadly effective against Delta and Kappa variants of the COVID-19 causing virus, which were first identified in India, according to a scientific study, underpinning a continued push to deliver the shots. The study by Oxford University researchers, published in the journal Cell, investigated the ability of antibodies in the blood from people, who were vaccinated with the two-shot regimens, to neutralize the highly contagious Delta and Kappa variants, a statement said. “There is no evidence of widespread escape suggesting that the current generation of vaccines will provide protection against the B.1.617 lineage,” the paper said, referring to the Delta and Kappa variants by a commonly used code. However, the concentration of neutralizing antibodies in the blood was somewhat reduced, which may lead to some breakthrough infections, they cautioned. Last week, an analysis by the Public Health England (PHE) showed that vaccines made by Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca offer high protection of more than 90% against hospitalization from the Delta variant. — Reuters 9:30 a.m. –Canada will lift more border restrictions in the weeks to come: Trudeau Canada will further relax border restrictions in the weeks to come as long as the science supports such a move, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday, suggesting Ottawa would move more quickly than initially announced.

India said on Wednesday it has found around 40 cases of the Delta coronavirus variant carrying a mutation that appears to make it more transmissible, and advised states to increase testing. WHAT IS DELTA PLUS? The variant, called “Delta Plus” in India, was first reported in a Public Health England bulletin on June 11. It is a sub-lineage of the Delta variant first detected in India and has acquired the spike protein mutation called K417N which is also found in the Beta variant first identified in South Africa. Some scientists worry that the mutation, coupled with other existing features of the Delta variant, could make it more transmissible. “The mutation K417N has been of interest as it is present in the Beta variant (B.1.351 lineage), which was reported to have immune evasion property,” India’s health ministry said in a statement. Shahid Jameel, a top Indian virologist, said the K417N was known to reduce the effectiveness of a cocktail of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. -Reuters 12 a.m. –Henry stays course on vaccine for children, despite no WHO policy She said there are now 1,001,192 people who have received the required two doses for full vaccination – or 22 per cent of adults.

COVID-19 Symptom Self-Assessment Tool 7:30 p.m. :Henry stays course on vaccine for children, despite no WHO policy B.C.’s policy to vaccinate children against COVID-19 is the right thing to do, despite no direction from the World Health Organization, says provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. Henry said Canada and other countries were immunizing children from 12 to 18 with Pfizer, the only WHO-approved vaccine for use in that age group. However, the WHO hadn’t made general recommendations on vaccinating kids against COVID-19, saying more evidence was needed. “That’s the decisions we’ve made in Canada and in many other countries,” Henry said. “We know that there has been studies done looking at safety and efficacy in children down to age 12, and there are additional studies being done in children down to six months of age.” As of Tuesday, 67,775 children between 12 and 18 had received one dose of Pfizer — about 1.5 per cent of all British Columbians who have received at least one dose. David Carrigg 4:30 p.m. – B.C. extends state of emergency The B.C. government has once again extended the provincial state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The state of emergency, which was first declared March 18, 2020, allows health and emergency officials to use the powers in the Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response. It has been extended until end of day July 6. “Better days are within reach this summer, but we need to carefully guard our progress against COVID-19,” said Premier John Horgan said in a statement. “People in B.C. have been doing their part by getting vaccinated, following the rules and working together to put the pandemic behind us. I’m asking everyone to stay on track through Step 2 of our restart so we can look forward to the opportunities that come with Step 3.” 3:15 p.m. –Risk-assessment tool for fully vaccinated Canadians coming soon, Tam promises Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says she’ll soon have advice to help fully vaccinated Canadians figure out what they can safely do, but it won’t be a blanket list of dos and don’ts covering everyone, everywhere. Instead, Canada is looking at a “risk assessment tool” that will guide Canadians to make a call on their own whether they are safe and comfortable to take off their masks and throw physical distancing to the wind. “It’s not a straight black and white, sort of everybody take off their masks, everybody just do whatever you want,” she said at a news conference Tuesday. “We would like to enable people to take themselves through that kind of risk assessment while respecting local public health requirements.” At least 7.7 million Canadians — one in five people — have received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, and that group is growing by one million people every two or three days. By the end of July, Canada expects to have enough doses to fully vaccinate all Canadians over the age of 12. The Centers for Disease Control in the United States issued general guidance for the fully vaccinated back in early March, when fewer than one in 10 Americans had all the required doses they needed. That included, for example, socializing indoors and maskless with other fully vaccinated people, and not having to quarantine or test after an exposure to COVID-19 as long as you didn’t develop symptoms. The CDC now says fully vaccinated Americans can travel without quarantining afterwards, though they do need a negative COVID-19 test before departing for the U.S. Canada is moving to follow suit July 6, when citizens and permanent residents can return home without quarantining, as long as they are fully vaccinated and test negative both before and after arriving. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday he will announce within the next few weeks when that can be expanded to fully vaccinated foreigners. — Reuters 3 p.m. – More than one million British Columbians now fully vaccinated Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has reported 56 new cases of COVID-19 over the past day and no deaths. She said there are now 1,001,192 people who have received the required two doses for full vaccination – or 22 per cent of adults. There have been 4,511,923 doses of the three approved vaccines administered. Henry said there are more doses of Moderna being administered as Pfizer supplies have dried up. People who have had a Pfizer as first dose are likely to get a second dose of Moderna. Both are mRNA vaccines. There are 1,039 active cases of COVID-19 in the community, plus 111 being treated in hospital including 41 in intensive care. Henry said there are three active outbreaks in health-care facilities. So far, 1,743 people have died of COVID-19 in B.C. Watch it live here: 12:30 p.m. – ‘Joints for Jabs:‘ Company offering cannabis prizes to fully vaccinated Manitobans A Winnipeg-based cannabis producer and retailer is hoping to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake with a chance to win free joints. Delta 9’s “Joints for Jabs” program is giving away three grand prizes of a one-year supply of cannabis to those who have received two doses of vaccine. It works out to $100 worth of cannabis per month. Other prizes include free joints and company apparel. Delta 9’s chief executive officer, John Arbuthnot, says the giveaway was created to encourage all Manitobans to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The contest runs until Sept. 30, and people can enter to win by visiting any of the company’s locations in the province. Participants will have to present proof they are fully vaccinated by showing their immunization records. – The Canadian Press 11:30 a.m. – Vancouver Coastal Health hosting four drop-in vaccination clinics Vancouver Coastal Health is hosting a series of drop-in vaccination clinics in the Lower Mainland and Whistler this week. The clinics in North Vancouver, Vancouver and Whistler is open to everyone aged 12 and over who has not received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine along with those aged 70 and older who are in need of a second dose. A Richmond clinic, meanwhile, will be providing first jabs to adults 55 to 69 and second doses to those over 70. The clinics will be held at: ICBC Claim Centre, 255 Lloyd Ave., North VancouverDates: June 22, 23 and 24Times: 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.Availability: 50 drop-in spots available per evening Vancouver Community College,1199 E. 7th Ave., VancouverDates: June 23, 26 and 27Times: 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.Availability: 400 drop-in spots available per day Richmond – Seniors Centre at the Minoru Centre for Active Living, 7191 Granville Ave., RichmondDate: June 25Times: 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.Availability: 200 drop-in spots Whistler Conference Centre, 4010 Whistler Way, WhistlerDate: June 27Times: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.Availability: 300 drop-in spots “All are welcome at our clinics, including those without personal health numbers and people who are not residents of B.C. Staff will be available on-site to help people register and book appointments at other clinics throughout the region if needed, and can help answer all vaccine-related questions,”  Vancouver Coastal Health said. 11 a.m. – Moscow restaurants to ban unvaccinated Moscow moved to ban unvaccinated guests from restaurants and cafes while the city’s hospital system works at capacity amid a record number of infections. Starting Monday, people will need to show a QR code that proves they have been vaccinated, recovered from COVID-19 within the last six months or received a negative PCR test in the last three days, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on his blog. More than 2 million residents in the city of 12.7 million have received at least one dose, and demand for vaccines has risen as much as fivefold since a citywide order requiring many workers to get inoculated, the mayor said. Still, the vaccine push will take up to three months to get results, forcing the city to institute new restrictions, according to Sobyanin. – Bloomberg 11 a.m. – U.S. to miss Biden’s vaccination target The White House acknowledged that the U.S. will likely fall short of President Joe Biden’s goal of getting 70 per cent of U.S. adults a first COVID-19 shot by the July 4 holiday. Jeffrey Zients, the head of the White House COVID-19 response team, said the administration had hit its 70 per cent vaccination target among Americans ages 30 and older, and is poised to reach that threshold for those 27 and older by Independence Day. It will take a few extra weeks to hit the 70 per cent mark for everyone 18 and older, Zients said. The pace of shots in the U.S. has fallen off by about two-thirds since April, with about 1.1 million doses now administered per day, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. At that rate, it will take another five months for 75 per cent of the population to be vaccinated. – Bloomberg 9:30 a.m.–Two-thirds of Canadians say governments shouldn’t lift all COVID-19 restrictions A new poll suggests about two-thirds of Canadians believe that governments should not lift all restrictions related to COVID-19. Sixty-nine per cent of respondents to an online survey by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say restrictions should stay in place as people continue to get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus. Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque said Canadians are still fairly prudent and careful regarding lifting the restrictions. “I believe they’re waiting until the end of the vaccination campaign, or at least until governments say that they’ve reached all of their targets, potentially to sort of relax a little bit,” he said in an interview. – The Canadian Press 9:30 a.m. – Construction complete on Montreal vaccinefacility Construction is complete on a new vaccine-manufacturing plant in Montreal that will be able to produce about 24 million doses a year. Federal Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne made the announcement today regarding the Biologics Manufacturing Centre, which is located on the National Research Council of Canada’s Royalmount site. The National Research Council of Canada says it is working with Novavax Inc. to produce a COVID-19 vaccine at the facility. The site is not yet fully licensed and operational, and equipment at the new factory is still being installed. – The Canadian Press 9 a.m. –Study reassures parents, teachers that COVID-19 infrequently shared at school A study of school staff in Vancouver says their risk of developing COVID-19 through contact at school is identical to their risk of catching the virus in the community. The study by researchers from BC Children’s Hospital, the University of British Columbia and Vancouver Coastal Health examined COVID-19 infections among teachers and staff throughout the Vancouver district. Blood samples taken from 1,556 school staff showed 2.3 per cent tested positive for antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19, mirroring the number of positive tests from a matching group of donors who did not work in schools. Researchers say the findings show the limited chance of developing COVID-19 through contact in a school setting. The study has not yet been peer reviewed but was published in preprint form in order to share the details quickly. Dr. Louise Masse, the article’s co-lead researcher and a professor in the School of Population and Public Health at UBC, says it’s hoped the findings will guide future decisions about school openings and closures. Vancouver School District superintendent Suzanne Hoffman says it’s important schools stay open, not just for learning but for the social, mental and physical well-being of students. – The Canadian Press 7 a.m. – B.C. government extends BC Hydro’s Customer Crisis Fund B.C. is extending BC Hydro’s Customer Crisis Fund to support people in financial crisis and help avoid disconnections of their electricity service. Energy Minister Bruce Ralston said their are still families struggling to recover from the impacts of the pandemic. “By extending BC Hydro’s Customer Crisis Fund, we are preventing disconnections, helping families get back on their feet and making life more affordable for British Columbians,” he said, in a statement Tuesday. The CCF program allows eligible BC Hydro customers who are facing a financial hardship due to a job loss, injury, illness or loss of a family member, and possible disconnection of their service, to access grants of up to $600 to pay their BC Hydro bill. A pilot of the CCF program ended on May 31. Since it was launched, the government says the fund has helped more than 11,000 residential customers. 12 a.m. – B.C. reports 45 new cases Monday, as close to one million fully vaccinated More than 77 per cent of B.C.’s adult population, and almost 76 per cent of people over the age of 12, have now received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. According to a joint statement issued by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and health minister Adrian Dix, 935,401 British Columbians have now received a second dose. B.C. recorded 229 new COVID-19 cases on the weekend, including 94 new cases from Friday to Saturday, 90 new cases from Saturday to Sunday and 45 new cases Monday. 12 a.m. – No quarantine for fully-vaccinated air travellers: Ottawa Fully vaccinated travellers will soon be able to return to Canada without a mandatory quarantine. The first stage in loosening the border restrictions that have been in place for 15 months will begin at 11:59 p.m. eastern time on July 5. It will apply only to people already eligible to travel to Canada, including citizens, permanent residents, and people registered under the Indian Act. Those travellers must have two doses of a vaccine approved by Health Canada, provide a negative COVID-19 test from 72 hours before arrival, take a second test upon arrival, and have a quarantine plan in the event the arrival test comes back positive. All others will still have to stay in hotel quarantine for up to three days pending a negative arrival test, and then quarantine at home for the remainder of the 14-day period. Children who aren’t vaccinated will be able to return home with their parents, but must quarantine there for two weeks and take a second test eight days after arriving home. – The Canadian Press B.C.

COVID-19 Symptom Self-Assessment Tool 4:15 p.m. – B.C. reports 45 new cases overnight, as close to one million fully vaccinated More than 77 per cent of B.C.’s adult population, and almost 76 per cent of people over the age of 12, have now received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. According to a joint statement issued by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and health minister Adrian Dix, 935,401 British Columbians have now received a second dose. Over the past three days, B.C. recorded 229 new COVID-19 cases, including 94 new cases from Friday to Saturday, 90 new cases from Saturday to Sunday and 45 new cases in the past 24 hours. Of the new cases, 51 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 99 are in the Fraser Health region, five are in the Island Health region, 60 are in the Interior Health region and 13 are in the Northern Health region. B.C. recorded three more deaths, bringing the total number of people who have died in the province due to COVID-19 to 1,743. The number of active COVID-19 cases in B.C. now stands at 1,204. There are 108 people hospitalized, including 48 in the ICU. There is one new health-care facility outbreak, at Eagle Ridge Hospital. 2:45 p.m. – Poor sleep history linked with more severe COVID-19 Poor sleep habits may be linked with higher risk for severe illness in patients with COVID-19, according to Harvard University researchers. They analyzed survey responses from more than 46,000 participants in the long-term UK Biobank study, including 8,422 who tested positive for COVID-19. Participants had answered questions from 2006 to 2010 about sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, insomnia and body clocks. For the new study, based on their responses, the researchers assigned scores ranging from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating multiple poor sleep “traits.” In participants with COVID-19, poor scores were associated with higher odds of death. This was true even after researchers accounted for issues known to be risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes such as sleep apnea, obesity and smoking, they reported on Friday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. Even people with two occasional or one frequent poor sleep trait appeared to experience higher risks for hospitalization and death, although the difference was not statistically significant and more study is needed to confirm the finding, the researchers said. Poor sleep affects the immune system and blood clotting, both of which are key to the body’s fight against COVID-19, and “tracking sleep behavior may have importance in identifying those at increased risk for COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization,” the authors said. — Reuters 2 p.m. –Even fully vaccinated, Canada will have to be vigilant against COVID outbreaks: Tam Canada is likely to hit major vaccine milestones in the next month with as much as 80 per cent of the country fully covered, but the country will still have to be ready for flare-ups and outbreaks, according to Canada’s chief public health officer. Vaccine shipments set to arrive in July will be enough to cover 80 per cent of Canadians with two doses, but in most countries around the world, especially developing ones, vaccine coverage won’t be anywhere near that high. And until vaccine coverage is high across the world, new variants could continue to emerge and strain public health resources. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, said Canada will have to be vigilant even after vaccinations reach a high point. “The bottom line is the public health capacity must be maintained in terms of our testing, sequencing, contact tracing and then isolation capacities,” she said. Tam said in conversations with provinces she has encouraged them to keep their contact tracing and testing capacity in place. She said they need to be able to react robustly to new cases that will creep in and prevent them from wider spread. “The provinces should have the capacity to be able to do that and investigate the outbreaks and look to see if there’s actual changes in the virus itself.” Alberta will be the first province in the country to remove all restrictions on July 1, including the province’s mask mandate. Saskatchewan is looking to follow suit on July 11, and even Ontario, the most cautious province in easing restrictions, should have most rules removed by the end of July. — Canadian Press 12:45 p.m. – Tokyo Olympic organizers reject health advice, allow spectators Up to 10,000 domestic spectators will be allowed in Tokyo 2020 venues, Olympics organizers said Monday, a decision that cuts against the recommendation of medical experts who said holding the event without fans was the least risky option. The announcement highlights Japan’s determination to push on with the Games and salvage the multi-billion-dollar extravaganza amid public opposition and deep concern about a resurgence in infections. Japan has largely avoided the kind of explosive coronavirus outbreaks that have devastated other countries, but the vaccine roll-out was initially slow and the medical system pushed to the brink in some places. The limit for the Games, scheduled to begin on July 23, will be up to 50 per cent of venue capacity, up to a maximum of 10,000 people, organizers said in a statement. Shouting will be prohibited, masks will be required and spectators will be asked to travel directly to venues and go straight home. Numbers could be further reduced after July 12, depending on whether “quasi emergency” COVID-19 measures, due to expire the day before, are extended or any other anti-infection measures in force at the time, according to organizers. Spectators from overseas have already been banned. Some of the country’s top health experts on Friday said banning spectators would be the least risky option. – Ottawa Citizen/Reuters 11 a.m. – Canadian tennis star Shapovalov withdraws from Tokyo Olympics Canadian tennis star Denis Shapovalov has decided not to compete at the Tokyo Olympics due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the world number 12 said on Monday. The 22-year-old Shapovalov is the latest player to opt out of the Olympics as Spaniard Rafa Nadal and Austria’s Dominic Thiem both announced last week they would not compete in the July 24-Aug. 1 men’s tennis tournament in Tokyo. “Representing Canada means the world to me, but due to the current situation my team and I have decided this is the best decision for everyone’s safety,” Shapovalov wrote on Twitter. “I can’t wait to represent Canada at future Olympic games.” Hey everyone, after careful consideration I wanted to let you know that I will not be participating in the Olympics this year. Representing Canada means the world to me, but due to the current situation my team and I have decided this is the best decision for everyone’s safety.pic.twitter.com/aQD5n2kFS7 Shapovalov, who reached the quarter-finals at last year’s U.S. Open, pulled out of this year’s French Open with a shoulder injury a day after he lost in the Geneva final. He has competed in two tournaments since, most recently in a Wimbledon tune-up at Queen’s Club in London where he lost in the semi-final on Saturday. – Reuters 9:30 a.m. –Despite 500,000 Covid deaths, Brazilians insist on waiting for Pfizer shots Brazil hit the grim mark of half a million Covid deaths Saturday, a toll second only to the U.S. that shows few signs of easing. Yet residents are spurning vaccines that they believe are substandard in favor of hard-to-find shots from Pfizer Inc. In Sao Paulo, people demand the U.S. company’s shots at public clinics and often walk out if none are available. Some health-care centers have put up signs saying “no Pfizer shots” to save time. Many vaccination centers are empty, and the few that have Pfizer have massive lines. Such reluctance is hobbling a vaccination campaign already plagued by shortages and delays. Failure to control the disease would harm not only Brazilians, who are dying at the rate of about 2,000 a day, but also threaten a global resurgence of the pandemic if the nation of 213 million becomes a breeding ground for new strains. China’s Sinovac and England’s AstraZeneca Plc account for about 96 per cent of shots available in the country, compared with just four per cent for Pfizer, according to government data. – Bloomberg 8 a.m. –Canada extends India, drops Pakistan from COVID flight ban Set to expire Tuesday, Ottawa’s ban on direct flights from India will be extended for another month. Announced Monday morning in a press conference by federal Transport Minister Omar Alghabra, Canada’s ban on passenger flights from india will be extended another month while flights from Pakistan are set to resume. Enacted April 22 to address a spike of passengers infected with what’s now known as the Delta variant of COVID-19, the measure drastically cut the number of cases entering Canada via international travel. The ban also included additional restrictions on travellers arriving via connecting flights, including negative PCR COVID-19 tests administered at the last port of entry before entering Canada — a nearly impossible feat for a laboratory test with a 24-48 hour turnaround time. – Postmedia 7:40 a.m. – India’s vaccinations hit record with free COVID shots India gave out a record 7.5 million vaccine doses on Monday under a federal campaign to inoculate all adults for free after weeks of criticism that a chaotic rollout had worsened a second wave that killed hundreds of thousands. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government would buy 75 per cent of all vaccines from drug makers and distribute them for free to states, which along with private hospitals had earlier been buying shots for people aged 18-45. India’s previous record of 4.5 million doses was on April 5, followed by a sharp decline with average daily inoculation falling below 3 million. Experts have said India needs to administer 10 million doses a day to achieve its aim of inoculating 950 million adults by December. So far, India has fully vaccinated fewer than 5 per cent with two doses. – Reuters 7 a.m. –No quarantine for fully-vaccinated air travellers: Ottawa Fully vaccinated travellers will soon be able to return to Canada without a mandatory quarantine.

Fraser Health, which hosted the COVID-19 immunization clinic at the Guildford Recreation Centre, says it reached its goal by providing 7,000 first doses of COVID-19 vaccines. The clinic, which was open to anyone 12 years and older, ran from 11 a.m. Saturday to 7 p.m. Sunday. 7000 people immunized! We are wrapping up our first Vax-a-thon which was a great success.

Claims increased in virtually every industry, with the exception of health care — particularly acute and long-term care, where claims “have been declining for several months,” Samantha Pinto, media relations officer at WorkSafeBC, wrote in an email. Residents and staff of long-term care facilities were among the first to receive vaccinations. Overall, however, the increase in claims “appears to reflect higher transmission of COVID-19 in B.C. (prior to introduction of the circuit breaker),” Pinto wrote. She noted that in June the government agency started seeing “a significant reduction” in the number of claims filed, “likely a result of the vaccination rollout.” Claims from teachers and others working in education were second only to health care, with nearly 300 claims registered as of June 11. Nearly 70 per cent of those came from elementary and kindergarten teachers and assistants – Nathan Griffiths 10 a.m. – China risks isolation in quest for virus origin, Biden aide says China will risk international isolation if it fails to allow a “real” investigation on its territory into the origins of the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. Sullivan’s comments follow last week’s call by Group of Seven leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden for another probe into how the virus originated. Biden last month ordered the U.S. intelligence community to “redouble” its efforts to determine where the coronavirus came from and to report back in 90 days. The goal is to present China with “a stark choice: Either they will allow, in a responsible way, investigators in to do the real work of figuring out where this came from, or they will face isolation in the international community,” Sullivan said in an interview on Fox News Sunday. The U.S. will continue pressing in cooperation with its allies and partners “until we get to the bottom of how this virus came into the world and who has accountability for that.” China has rejected the theory that the virus originated in a lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the first cases were reported. The World Health Organization investigation, which previously sent a mission to China to report on the virus origins, is expected to lead a second probe separately from the U.S. intelligence effort. –Bloomberg B.C.

COVID-19 Symptom Self-Assessment Tool SUNDAY 3:15 p.m. –Habs coach’s positive COVID-19 test after second vaccine dose a call to stay vigilant Montreal Canadiens head coach Dominique Ducharme’s positive COVID-19 test should serve as a reminder partially vaccinated people can contract the virus, an infectious diseases expert says. Ducharme’s COVID-19 test was administered on June 17, only eight days after he received his second dose of the vaccine. The test came back positive, but a spokesperson for the Canadiens said Ducharme is still feeling fine. The Canadiens confirmed that all of the players, coaches and other staff also received their second doses on June 9. Dr. Matthew Oughton, a specialist in infectious diseases, said the high-profile positive test after a second dose should remind people they are not fully vaccinated until two weeks after their second shot. pointed to recent data out of the United Kingdom looking at the protection provided by the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines against the super-contagious Delta variant after one dose versus two. The vaccines provided only about 35- to 40-per-cent protection against hospitalization after one dose, but the rate of protection went beyond 90 per cent two weeks after a second dose. – Montreal Gazette 3 p.m. – Saskatchewan announces all COVID-19 public health measures will end July 11 Saskatchewan will lift all remaining public health measures meant to protect against COVID-19 as of July 11, making it the second province to do so, behind only Alberta. The province can move to Step 3 of its pandemic reopening plan because Saskatchewan is so close to reaching the vaccination thresholds needed for a full re-opening, Premier ScottMoe said. “We are able to make this announcement because so many Saskatchewan residents have done their part by getting vaccinated, so I’d like to say thanks to Saskatchewan people,” Moesaid, announcing the news in the province’s daily pandemic update on Sunday. “Over the past 15 months, Saskatchewan residents have diligently followed public health guidelines and restrictions, and over the past months they have followed through by getting vaccinated.” The update said 70 per cent of residents over the age of 18 and 69 per cent of those over 12 have received at least their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. – The Canadian Press 10:15 a.m. –WorkSafeBC has already approved more COVID-19 claims this year than in all of 2020 WorkSafeBC approved over 2,000 claims for work-related COVID-19 exposures by June 11 — almost 300 more than were approved in all of 2020. Claims increased in virtually every industry, with the exception of health care — particularly acute and long-term care, where claims “have been declining for several months,” Samantha Pinto, media relations officer at WorkSafeBC, wrote in an email. Residents and staff of long-term care facilities were among the first to receive vaccinations. Overall, however, the increase in claims “appears to reflect higher transmission of COVID-19 in B.C. (prior to introduction of the circuit breaker),” Pinto wrote. She noted that in June the government agency started seeing “a significant reduction” in the number of claims filed, “likely a result of the vaccination rollout.” Claims from teachers and others working in education were second only to health care, with nearly 300 claims registered as of June 11. Nearly 70 per cent of those came from elementary and kindergarten teachers and assistants – Nathan Griffiths 10 a.m. – China risks isolation in quest for virus origin, Biden aide says China will risk international isolation if it fails to allow a “real” investigation on its territory into the origins of the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. Sullivan’s comments follow last week’s call by Group of Seven leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden for another probe into how the virus originated. Biden last month ordered the U.S. intelligence community to “redouble” its efforts to determine where the coronavirus came from and to report back in 90 days. The goal is to present China with “a stark choice: Either they will allow, in a responsible way, investigators in to do the real work of figuring out where this came from, or they will face isolation in the international community,” Sullivan said in an interview on Fox News Sunday. The U.S. will continue pressing in cooperation with its allies and partners “until we get to the bottom of how this virus came into the world and who has accountability for that.” China has rejected the theory that the virus originated in a lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the first cases were reported. The World Health Organization investigation, which previously sent a mission to China to report on the virus origins, is expected to lead a second probe separately from the U.S. intelligence effort. –Bloomberg SATURDAY 5 a.m. –Travel troubles the latest woe for AstraZeneca vaccine Blame Bruce Springsteen for beleaguered AstraZeneca’s latest woes. The rocker’s recent concert announcement, which excludes people who haven’t been vaccinated by one of three vaccines, has some British Columbians wondering if they made the right choice. The AstraZeneca vaccine, which has been linked to rare blood clotting, has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Those who received two doses of AstraZeneca won’t be able to attend Springsteen’s live Broadway show in New York, which is only open to fans who can show proof of being vaccinated with an FDA-approved vaccine. Setting aside the fact that it’s almost impossible for someone in B.C. to travel to New York right now, the news is worrying many who followed advice from local health officials and took the first vaccine they were offered. Michael Slavitch said he made two separate appointments for his second dose, but now plans to cancel his AstraZeneca shot and take an mRNA one instead. Slavitch said he’s particularly concerned about whether his AstraZeneca vaccine, or mixing and matching, will be accepted by other countries as international travel opens up. “I’m confused about what to do,” he said. “Our government is responsible for cleaning up this mess.” -Glenda Luymes 5 a.m. –Where can you go in the U.S. if you got the AstraZeneca shot? Not everywhere Canadians who have been dosed with the AstraZeneca shot may not be allowed into some events in the U.S. until the Food and Drug Administration gives the vaccine the green light. Rocker Bruce Springsteen is reopening his live Broadway show in New York next week, but fans who want to attend need to show proof that they have been inoculated with vaccines approved by the FDA, such as Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson. Those who received AstraZeneca, yet to be approved for use in the U.S., would not be allowed into the event, setting what may be a disappointing precedent for Canadians looking to attend events across the border. Live tapings of popular TV shows such as Saturday Night Live and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert have also excluded AstraZeneca vaccine recipients, in rules published online, with the explanation that they’re acting as per “the direction of New York State.” Other Broadway shows looking to return in September have also indicated that they will follow COVID-19 protocols established at the time of the performance, but have not yet specified vaccination policies for audience members. More than 1.7 million Canadians have received the AstraZeneca jab, the London Daily Telegraph reported. The issue may still be up for discussion, Ontario Solicitor General Sylvia Jones told the Toronto Sun, with an assurance that Ontarians who received a double dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine will be treated the same as recipients of other vaccines. “We will make sure that individuals in Ontario and Canada who received a Health Canada-NACI approved AstraZeneca will have the same rights as individuals who received other vaccines,” she said. – Devika Desai 5 a.m. – An update on B.C.’s reopening plans In B.C., seated gatherings of up to 50 people are allowed at banquet halls, movie theatres and theatre performances. High-intensity fitness classes are allowed and bars can serve liquor until midnight. Indoor faith gatherings are allowed with a maximum of 50 people or up to 10 per cent of a building’s capacity. Recreational travel within B.C. is allowed, but the province is asking those planning to visit from other provinces to delay thoseplans until more people have had their vaccines. The province is testing every positive COVID-19 case for variants of concern and testing, tracking and tracing for each case remains a priority. Rules for masks and physical distancing remain in place. -The Canadian Press 12 a.m. –One additional death and 109 new cases of COVID-19 The province recorded 109 new cases Friday and one more death bringing the total number of deaths to 1,740 in British Columbia since the beginning of the pandemic.

The best vaccine is the first vaccine you’re offered.pic.twitter.com/GPWeCJpC5m 3:15 p.m. – Public Health Agency reports spike in confirmed cases of Delta variant in Canada The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases attributed to the highly contagious Delta variant jumped 66 per cent in Canada this week. Canada’s chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said as of Friday there are just over 2,000 confirmed cases of the variant. Just three days ago, the Public Health Agency told The Canadian Press there were 1,187 confirmed cases. “The Delta variant is now in all provinces and at least one of our territories,” Tam said at the House of Commons health committee. “Of course, as with all coronavirus cases, we may not know every single case that has occurred in Canada, hence my warning of precaution and the need to get two doses of vaccine into as many people as possible.” The variant was first identified in India but has now become the dominant strain in the United Kingdom where it is spreading rapidly, mostly among unvaccinated people. It is believed to be at least 1.5 times as contagious as the Alpha variant first identified in the U.K. Alpha is, for now, the dominant variant in Canada, with more than 216,000 cases confirmed. — Canadian Press 3 p.m. –One additional death and 109 new cases of COVID-19 The province recorded 109 new cases and one more death bringing the total number of deaths to 1,740 in British Columbia since the beginning of the pandemic. B.C. has now vaccinated 76.7 per cent of all adults in the province and 75.1 per cent of those 12 and older have received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. In total, 4,296,151 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in B.C., 823,371 of which are second doses. No new cases were recorded in the Island Health region today. 1:45 p.m. – Court upholds constitutionality of quarantine program The Federal Court of Canada has upheld the constitutionality of the federal government’s quarantine hotel program. Today’s ruling written by Chief Justice Paul Crampton says that pandemics, like wars, require sacrifices to save lives and prevent broad-based suffering. He adds that anyone engaging in behaviour that poses a risk to the health and safety of others cannot expect the law to prevent the state from performing its essential function of protecting its citizens from that risk. The ruling does take aim at border officials for not informing one of the applicants about the location of her quarantine hotel, nor her right to retain a lawyer, saying both moves violated her constitutional rights. But Crampton affirms the constitutionality of the overall program. A government order that went into effect on Feb. 14 mandates that anyone entering Canada from abroad must stay in a federally approved hotel for the first three nights of a 14-day quarantine. Travellers are expected to pay for their government-approved accommodations while awaiting the results of a COVID-19 test they have to take on arrival. — Canadian Press 9:30 a.m. –Fraser Health announces 32-hour “Vax-a-thon” on Saturday Come for the party, stay for the vaccine. Fraser Health is hosting its first 32-hour, all-night “Vax-a-thon” this weekend in Surrey at the COVID-19 immunization clinic at Guildford Recreation Centre. The Vax-a-thon runs from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sunday, with health officials providing 7,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Fraser Health says those who attend will see live music and other physically-distanced entertainment while receiving their jab. They can also enter to win door prizes. Starting at 8 p.m., there will be a “Mask-erade” so folks can don their fanciest masks or come as they for the nighttime immunization clinic. After attendees receive their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, they can commemorate the moment by strolling down a red carpet and posing for a picture at a selfie station, said Fraser Health, in a news release Friday. On Sunday, people can celebrate Father’s Day by receiving their first COVID-19 vaccine. Appointments are open to anyone 12 years and older for first dose COVID-19 immunization. Staff are available on-site to help people register and book appointments at other clinics throughout the region if needed, and can help answer all vaccine-related questions. 8 a.m. –NACI advice to mix vaccines gets varied reaction from AstraZeneca double-dosers When Gwenny Farrell booked her second dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on the first day it became available, she said she believed she was doing the right thing. The resident of White Rock said she has tried to follow every health protocol and recommendation strictly, so her confidence has been shaken by a new recommendation from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization on mixing the vaccines. On June 1, NACI had said AstraZeneca recipients “could” get Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna for their second shot if they wanted, but on Thursday it went further to say an mRNA vaccine was the “preferred” choice. “I’m frustrated because now, after being told for months that the best vaccine is the first one that’s in your arm, I’m being told I may have made a mistake,” Farrell, 55, said. The new recommendation is drawing mixed reaction from those who’ve already received two jabs of AstraZeneca. Farrell is not alone in her disappointment, while others say they remain happy with their choice because they know it still means they are well protected against COVID-19. The committee’s guidance is based on the growing supply of mRNA vaccines, growing evidence that a second dose of an mRNA vaccine produces a stronger immune response, and because of the low but serious risk of vaccine-induced blood clots associated with AstraZeneca. “People who received two doses of AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine can rest assured that the vaccine provides good protection against infection and very good protection against severe disease and hospitalization,” NACI’s advice says. The committee also updated its previous recommendation that people at high risk of exposure to, or serious illness from, COVID-19, could opt to get AstraZeneca rather than waiting for Pfizer or Moderna. Now NACI says everyone should always get the mRNA vaccines first, unless they are allergic to them. -The Canadian Press 7 a.m. –Restrictions at U.S. border to remain in place until end of July, Blair says Travel restrictions at the Canada-U.S. border will remain in place for at least another month. Public Safety Minister Bill Blair says the American and Canadian governments are extending restrictions on non-essential international travel until July 21. He adds in a tweet that the government will provide details on Monday about plans to let fully vaccinated Canadians and permanent residents enter the country. The measures at the border have been in place since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The pressure to relax the restrictions has been building from businesses on both sides of the border, and increasingly from American lawmakers as vaccination rates climb in Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has previously said that it would take 75 per cent of Canadians getting vaccinated before restrictions can be lifted. To that threshold Trudeau has also added the caveat that the outbreak needs to be at a stage where minor flare-ups can handled without risk of spreading more broadly. -The Canadian Press 5 a.m. –From first ministers to farmers, many pushing for Canada-U.S. border reopening plan The manager of an American dairy with three locations near the Canada-U.S. border wants politicians to lay out a plan for reopening. “Cows keep producing whether the border is open or not,” said Mitch Moorlag, general manager of Edaleen Dairy. “We need to know when demand (from Canadian customers) will come back so we can be ready.” Moorlag, whose business is partly built on the concept of the cross-border milk run, isn’t the only one calling on Canada’s federal government to give some indication of when and how COVID-19-related restrictions will ease. The B.C. Premier’s Office confirmed the topic came up at a First Ministers’ meeting between the provincial premiers and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday. The feds have been deciding on a monthly basis whether to renew the restrictions at the Canada-U.S. border, with the current order due to expire Monday. While there isn’t consensus between the premiers on when the border should reopen to non-essential travel, many are pressing Ottawa to share its plan. “There was unanimity among the provinces when we closed the border, but since then there has been a back-and-forth across Canada — north and south, east and west — on what is the best way forward,” B.C. Premier John Horgan said earlier this week. Horgan raised the topic at Thursday’s meeting, sharing British Columbian’s views on the need for a safe reopening and more information on how it will proceed, including an early signal to the cruise ship industry. The federal government has hinted that the reopening might not begin Monday, but the new order could outline a plan for a gradual reopening starting in July. -Glenda Luymes 12 a.m. – One more death, 120 new cases and more supplies of Moderna expected next week B.C. has vaccinated 76.5 per cent of all adults, according to health officials. The province has administered 4,231,871 doses of COVID-19 vaccine, including 768,008 second doses, and 74.8 per cent of everyone 12 years of age and older have now received their first dose of vaccine. The province recorded 120 new cases on Thursday and one additional death of a person in their 80s, who died at the outbreak at Richmond Hospital. There are three long-term care and assisted-living homes, and acute care facilities affected. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry noted that there will be “upcoming challenges” with the delivery of doses of Pfizer vaccine in early July, and supply will be reduced. But B.C. will be receiving more Moderna shipments next week. Following the NACI recommendation, Henry also assured the public that mixing and matching of the vaccines is safe and effective. 12 a.m.–mRNA vaccine now preferred as second dose after initial AstraZeneca shot: NACI Canada’s federal expert advisory panel on vaccines is now recommending people who got the AstraZeneca vaccine for their first shot should get an mRNA vaccine for the second shot. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization said Pfizer or Moderna are “preferred” as the second dose based on growing evidence that a second mRNA shot produces a better immune response as well as to mitigate potential risk of blood clots that has been associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. The committee also recommended those who receive a first dose of an mRNA vaccine should be offered the same product for their second dose. If that product is not available, another mRNA vaccine can be used to complete the two-dose series. -David Carrigg B.C.

The Ministry of Education and B.C.’s Provincial Health Officer are counting on high vaccination rates to allow students to return to “a near normal school year” this fall. Dr. Bonnie Henry said she expects a majority of adults and children between the ages of 12 and 17 will have received their second dose of vaccine by September, and that will protect students under the age of 12, who are not yet permitted to receive vaccines. “Even if young children aren’t immunized, they are protected because those around them are immunized,” said Henry.  “With vaccine protection, transmission doesn’t happen at rates as we have seen in the past.” Education Minister Jennifer Whiteside said $18 million dollars will be targeted to “assess the impacts and deliver resources and recovery strategies” to help students who have fallen behind academically. -Lisa Cordasco 7 a.m. – Vaccine clinics set up for construction workers in Lower Mainland Constructions workers in the Lower Mainland can now get into a COVID-19 vaccine “fast lane.” Three vaccine clinics have been set up in Vancouver, Burnaby, and Abbotsfordwhere workers can show up between 1:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. on designated dates in June and July to get their first vaccine shot. Pre-registration is not required, although workers should wear their hard hat or bring construction ID or a site access card. “(After) a long day on the job site it can be hard to prioritize getting your vaccine scheduled when you get home,” said Chris Atchison, president of the B.C. Construction Association, which announced the initiative Thursday. “We want to make it as easy as possible for workers to keep themselves, their families and their sites safe, and are appreciative of the efforts made by the Fraser and Vancouver Coast Health to accommodate our essential workforce.” The locations of the program were selected by the Vancouver Regional Construction Association for their proximity to a high density of workers and construction sites. The clinics will operate June 24, 25, 30 and July 8, 9 at: 6 a.m. –B.C. public health officials prepare to manage COVID-19 differently in the future The future of COVID-19 could look a lot like seasonal flus or other common illnesses like measles or pneumonia, British Columbia’s deputy provincial health officer says. Dr. Reka Gustafson said it’s hard to speculate on the longevity of COVID-19 but public health officials are preparing for a shift to more typical communicable disease management based on the characteristics and behaviour of the virus. “We certainly wouldn’t be surprised if this virus turns into one of the circulating coronaviruses in the population. That would be our best bet at this point,” she said in an interview. British Columbia entered the second stage of its reopening plan Tuesday after surpassing target rates for first-dose vaccinations amid a sharp decline in new cases. More restrictions are scheduled to be lifted on July 1 and the fourth and final stage of the reopening plan is slated to go into effect on Sept. 7, if that trajectory continues. For the public, life should return to pre-pandemic norms of interaction in September if all goes as planned, Gustafson said, adding that she believes the plan is “very cautious and sensible.” Behind the scenes, public health officials are anticipating a shift away from emergency pandemic management toward communicable disease control, she said. However, even as a more routine strategy replaces the all-hands-on-deck approach, Gustafson said it will involve many of the same tools: testing, surveillance, case and contact management, and immunization strategies. -The Canadian Press 12 a.m. – B.C. reports 113 new cases of COVID-19 and four deaths Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says there are 1,320 active cases of COVID-19 in the community with 134 being treated in hospital, including 41 in intensive care. Henry reported 113 new cases on Wednesday and four deaths – bringing that total to 1,738 since the pandemic was declared in March, 2020. COVID-19 cases, active cases and hospitalizations are all falling. Henry said B.C. had among the highest levels of dose one vaccination in the world. On Tuesday there were 62,237 doses administered across B.C., most of which (53,356) were second doses. There have now been 3,454,295 people in B.C. who have received at least one dose of vaccine, or 74.5 per cent of people aged 12 and over. 12 a.m. – Pandemic to last at least two years, says UK health official COVID-19 variants will continue to emerge and “we will not be through this pandemic until the whole world has the ability to get vaccinated,” Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England’s National Infection Service, said at a House of Commons science committee meeting. “And that realistically is two years away.” “And until that, where we get some level of control over everything, we will continue to see variants emerge, we will continue to run behind as we try and understand this, and we will get to a position of stability, where we are with … seasonal influenza. – Bloomberg B.C.

COVID-19 Symptom Self-Assessment Tool 3 p.m. – No deaths reported in B.C. as one-dose vaccination effort leads world Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has reported no COVID-19 deaths and 108 new cases of the disease. She said there were 1,357 active cases in the community and 139 being treated in hospital, including 39 in intensive care. Canada has the highest proportion of adults vaccinated with one dose in the world, at 65 per cent, while B.C. leads Canada with 76.1 per cent – making it the world leader. According toWorld in Data, Canada tops Israel, the U.K. and Chile in first doses, however those countries have a greater percentage fully vaccinated. On Monday, there were 55,000 doses of vaccine delivered – mostly Pfizer – of which 44,000 were second doses. There has now been 657,491 second doses administered to 14.5 per cent of adults in B.C., and 76.1 per cent of adults have had at least one dose. 12:30 p.m. – Canada’s vaccine targets based on models before troublesome Delta variant well known Canada is on the cusp of its hitting its first national vaccination target, but chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says the Delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 might mean the country has to up its game again. Federal modelling done in April and May suggested that if 75 per cent of eligible Canadians had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 20 per cent had two, provinces could safely begin easing restrictions on public movement without overwhelming hospitals again. When 75 per cent of eligible people are fully vaccinated, the modelling suggested personal measures like physical distancing and wearing masks could also begin to loosen. Tam says the variants used to develop those models didn’t include Delta, which is the most infectious one tracked in Canada to date, believed to cause more severe illness, and is expected to become the dominant variant circling. She says knowing that one dose is proving to be less effective against Delta, but two doses are doing very well, it is more important than ever to aim for full vaccination as quickly as possible and probably aim for even higher than 75 per cent. – The Canadian Press 8:45 a.m. –Single dose of vaccine protects against Delta variant, study People who are concerned about how much protection vaccinations offer against the more contagious Delta variant can take some comfort from data emerging from England. One dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine offers 94 per cent protection against hospitalization due to COVID-19 caused by Delta, according to a preprint study from Public Health England published June 14. One dose of AstraZeneca is 71 per cent effective. After two doses, the effectiveness against hospitalization rises to 96 per cent for Pfizer and 92 per cent for AstraZeneca. Those are measures of protection against severe illness. The efficacy of both vaccines against contracting COVID-19 caused by Delta and having milder symptoms is lower. Here’s the key table from@PHE_uknew report on vaccine efficacy against hospitalisation with Delta variant:After 1 dose• Pfizer: 94% effective• AstraZeneca: 71% effectiveAfter 2 doses• Pfizer: 96%• AstraZeneca: 92%Full preprint here:https://t.co/JQQjo0gSdgpic.twitter.com/osSjIZ0eA6 – Postmedia 8:45 a.m. – AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail fails to stop COVID-19 in study AstraZeneca Plc’s antibody cocktail was only 33% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in people who had been exposed to the virus, failing a study that was key to the drugmaker’s pandemic push. The trial of 1,121 adult volunteers looked at whether the long-acting antibody combination could protect people who had recently been in contact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in places like care homes. The company said it’s running other studies of the medicine that could help clarify the findings. The outcome is a blow to Astra for a drug that was hoped to be a bright spot in the company’s pandemic efforts following the mixed success of its vaccine with the University of Oxford. Other drugmakers such as GlaxoSmithKline Plc have had some success in getting similar therapies through clinical tests and authorized for people who are at risk of severe disease or can’t get vaccinated. The study, conducted in the U.S. and U.K., showed 23 volunteers who got the AZD7442 cocktail developed symptomatic COVID-19 following exposure to the disease, compared with 17 cases in the placebo group. Twice as many participants got the antibody, but the difference between the two groups wasn’t considered statistically significant. The cocktail was well tolerated by participants. – Bloomberg 3 a.m. – Police road checks on non-essential travel end As COVID-19 restrictions on non-essential travel within B.C. are lifted today, police road checks established in the first week of May have also come to an end. RCMP Staff Sgt. Janelle Shoihet says more than 14,000 vehicles were stopped at the checkpoints set up along several highways on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays between May 6th and last weekend. She says just 26 vehicles were told to turn around by police and another 236 voluntarily turned around at the checks established to prevent people from travelling between three regional zones for non-essential reasons. No tickets were handed out as a result of the checks. — The Canadian Press 12 a.m. –COVID-19 restart: Travel restrictions lifted, more activities allowed in Step 2 Starting Tuesday, British Columbians can once again travel freely throughout the province and gather in larger numbers under Step 2 of the provincial restart plan. This is the next step forward in allowing life to return to pre-pandemic times after Labour Day, Premier John Horgan told a news conference on Monday. “Dr. Henry’s modelling shows we’re on the right path. Case counts are declining, hospitalizations are stabilizing and vaccinations are climbing at a positive rate. What we need to do now is take the next careful steps forward.” There were just 68 cases of COVID-19 reported in B.C. on Sunday — with 1,537 active case of which 136 are being treated in hospital. All these numbers are steadily falling while more than three quarters of people have received at least on dose of vaccine. Step 2 allows individuals to host up to 50 people outdoors, but indoor private gatherings will remain limited to five guests or one other household. Indoor gatherings of up to 50 people will be allowed in regulated settings, such as banquet halls and restaurants. Liquor service will be extended until midnight at all restaurants, bars and pubs. But Henry said safety protocols, including mask wearing indoors and physical distancing, remain in place. Health officials will monitor COVID-19 case data as the date approaches for the next step in the reopening plan on July 1. — Lisa Cordasco 12 a.m. –B.C. premier tells Albertans to be patient as travel advisory remains in place Residents of British Columbia can now travel freely in their own province, the B.C. government announced Monday — but Canadians from other provinces are asked to stay out, at least for another couple of weeks. B.C. Premier John Horgan said the province would be moving to Step 2 of its reopening strategy on June 15, but the travel advisory against interprovincial travel remains in effect. “We’re going to welcome you down the road, but not today,” he said, speaking to Canadians during a briefing Monday morning. “If you don’t have business in B.C. it’s our preference you stay where you are and we will invite you back at the appropriate time when all British Columbians are prepared to welcome you.” Across the tourism industry in parts of B.C., many are excited about advancing to Step 2 and say it gives businesses the time they desperately need to prepare for what is likely to be a busy summer for visitation. Kathy Cooper, CEO of Kootenay Rockies Tourism, said many British Columbians are breathing a sigh of relief that the province was able to get to this step and are already looking forward to the next stage, which will see interprovincial travel allowed by as early at July 1. — Postmedia 12 a.m. –B.C.’s key COVID-19 metrics keep falling COVID-19 cases, active cases, hospitalizations, tests, positive results and the number of people in intensive care continues to fall in B.C. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reported just 68 cases on Sunday – the lowest since the start of the second wave of the pandemic in late August. Henry said there were 277 cases identified from Friday to Sunday — or 92 a day on average (96 on Friday, 113 on Saturday and 68 on Sunday). Of the 4,186 tests done on Sunday 2.6 per cent were positive, while the number of daily tests and percent positive outcomes continues to fall since the peak of the third wave in late April. Henry said there are 1,401 active cases of COVID-19 in the community and 136 being treated in hospital – including 42 in intensive care. This is the lowest number in hospital since Nov. 8. There were four deaths over the past three days, bringing that total to 1,734. — David Carrigg 12 a.m. –More than 250,000 Albertans register online for first $1-million vaccine lottery: Kenney More than one-quarter of a million Albertans registered online Monday afternoon for a new lottery meant to encourage everyone to get the COVID-19 vaccine. At an afternoon press conference, Premier Jason Kenney announced the launch of the Open for Summer Lottery, with those over the age of 18 who have received at least one shot eligible to enter three $1-million draws. The first is to be held in July. “We need everyone on the fence, those who want to get a shot but have just been putting it off for a while, to get their dose now,” he said. Brock Harrison, Kenney’s director of communications and planning, posted on Twitter following the announcement that there were 56,943 entries within the first hour, and 268,333 as of 4 p.m. Monday. Those who are eligible can register at www.alberta.ca/lottery. They only need to enter once, but must be able to provide proof they have received their first dose to collect the winnings. To win the August and September draws, you must be able to provide proof of a second dose. The first lottery is meant to boost vaccination uptake, which is a key marker in the province’s reopening plan but has slowed recently. — National Post B.C.

COVID-19 Symptom Self-Assessment Tool 3 p.m. – Numbers keep falling as B.C. moves into Step 2 of pandemic recovery plan Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reported just 68 cases of COVID-19 on Monday, as active cases fell to 1,537. Henry said there were total 277 cases reported from Friday to Sunday — or 92 a day on average (96 on Friday, 113 on Saturday and 68 on Sunday). She said there were 136 people in hospital with COVID-19, of which 42 were in intensive care. All these numbers are falling steadily as the province moves into Step 2 of the Restart Plan. Henry reported four new deaths over the past three days, bringing that total to 1,734. There are no new health-care facility outbreaks and three were declared over, bringing that total to four. Almost 14 per cent of adults in B.C. are fully vaccinated (613,453) as second dosing ramps up – with 115,521 second doses administered over the past three days. So far 4,048,346 doses have been administered to 74.1 per cent of people aged over 12 in the province. On Monday, Alberta reported 115 new cases and 3,089 active cases and 270 people in hospital. 2 p.m. – B.C. Ferries website crashes as travel restrictions lift The British Columbia Ferry Services website crashed on Monday, the same day the B.C. government was announcing an end to the ban on non-essential interprovincial travel. Restrictions that prohibit British Columbians from travelling between the government’s three health zones for recreational reasons will be lifted Tuesday as the B.C. government moves forward with the second phase of its COVID-19 restart plan. The news sent a rush of people to the B.C. Ferries website but they were unable to make sailing reservations because the site was not operational. B.C. Ferries blamed the outage on “technical difficulties” and advised people to make a reservations by phone at1-888-223-3779. #BCFHeadsUpOur website is currently experiencing technical difficulties and we are working hard to restore its service as soon as possible. We thank you for your patience, and apologize for any inconvenience that results from its outage. ^ge 1:15 p.m. – Experts divided on whether COVID-19 rules should be eased for fully vaccinated adults As provinces accelerate their efforts to get their populations fully vaccinated against COVID-19, some people are calling for the federal government to issue clear guidance on what people can do once they receive both shots. Ontario’s health minister and some experts say Ottawa should provide a framework spelling out which behaviours are considered safe for vaccinated adults, similar to what was issued by the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but opinion is divided on whether it’s a good idea. Dr. Nazeem Muhajarine, a professor of community health and epidemiology at the University of Saskatchewan, believes the federal government should be offering some general direction about what people can or cannot do once they’re fully vaccinated with two doses. However, he believes more people need to get their second dose and more data on vaccine effectiveness against variants is needed before restrictions on mask-wearing can be lifted for the fully vaccinated. Azim Shariff, a social psychologist at the University of British Columbia, believes allowing greater freedom to fully vaccinated people is worth considering, because it can work as an incentive to encourage hesitant people to get the shot. But Dr. Donald Vinh, an infectious diseases specialist at the McGill University Health Center, believes that creating a separate set of restrictions for people who are fully vaccinated is a risky idea. He says the guidelines issued in the United States are difficult to enforce and have led many people to abandon masks and distancing, whether they were vaccinated or not. — The Canadian Press 11 a.m. –CFL to return to the field in August Canadian Football League governors voted 9-0 Monday to kick off the abbreviated 2021 season on Aug. 5. The full 16-week, 63-game schedule is due to be released on Tuesday. Teams will play 14 games apiece and have two bye weeks. “This is an exciting day for Canadian football and for Canada itself,”CFLCommissioner Randy Ambrosie said in a news release. “I want to thank our fans, players, coaches, and partners for their incredible support and patience as we’ve worked together towards this day.” The Grey Cup championship game will be played Dec. 12 in Hamilton, Ontario. The league scrapped its 2020 season entirely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 10:30 a.m. –B.C. moves to Step 2 of restart on Tuesday Premier John Horgan says British Columbia will move Tuesday to its second phase of the four-step restart plan launched last month with relaxed restrictions on gatherings, outdoor team sports and indoor and outdoor dining. The relaxed restrictions will allow for indoor seated organized gatherings of up to 50 people, children’s playdates, interprovincial travel to all B.C. health zones, indoor team sports for all ages, the return of high-intensity indoor fitness classes, up to 50 spectators allowed at outdoor sports events and extension of liquor service hours until midnight. The province is still advising against non-essential out-of-province travel. “My advice to non-British Columbians: if you don’t have business here that’s essential to your well being, then please stay,” Horgan said. Health officials were looking to a 65 per cent vaccination rate by June 14 to move to the second step of the reopening plan. The province exceeded that goal on Friday with 75 per cent of adults receiving at least one dose of vaccine. Horgan says the four-step plan looks to the return B.C. to its pre-pandemic ways after Sept. 7, when crowds will hopefully be allowed at indoor sports events and masks will be optional. As for now, masks remain mandatory in all indoor public spaces and personal gatherings inside homes remain restricted to five people or one household. “We need to continue with our safety plans,” said provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. “Physical distancing and giving others space is also still required. We need to recognize that not everybody is at the same place right now. And we need to respect their ability to stay away from others. “This will be our summer of hope and healing from this pandemic.” On the same day that B.C. announced relaxed restrictions, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson delayed reopening plans n England by at least four weeks due to increased transmission linked to the highly contagious Delta variant that was originally detected in India. Henry says she is monitoring the presence of the variant in B.C., where it has been linked to at least one outbreak at a long-term care home, but she suggested the province is better prepared for the variant than the UK was. “We have increased the level of protection for immunization across the board. So we are in a little bit of a different place than the UK,” she said. “A lot of transmission that they’re seeing right now in the UK is in people in their teens, 20s and 30s. We have very high immunization rates in those age groups already.” Things you can do with Step 2 restart: • B.C. recreational travel – non-essential travel ban lifted. Out-of-province non-essential travel advisory continues; • maximum of 50 people for outdoor personal gatherings; • maximum of 50 people for indoor seated organized gatherings (e.g., movie theatres, live theatre, banquet halls) with safety plans; • indoor faith gatherings — a maximum of 50 people, or 10 per cent of a place of worship’s total capacity, whichever number is greater — with safety plans; • maximum of 50 spectators for outdoor sports; • liquor service at restaurants, bars and pubs extended until midnight; • and indoor sports games (no spectators) and high-intensity fitness with safety plans.

The government was forced to act after modeling showed hospital admissions could reach similar levels to the pandemic’s first wave of infections in spring 2020 — a peak of 3,099 a day — if Johnson stuck to his schedule to end social-distancing rules on June 21. In a televised press conference on Monday, Johnson said he had no choice but to delay his plan until July 19 at the earliest, to allow more people to get their second vaccine dose. – Bloomberg 10 a.m. – Quebec to reopen border with Ontario Quebec will reopen its border with Ontario on Wednesday, the province’s Public Security Department said Monday. Travel from Ontario to Quebec has been restricted since April 19, due to concerns about the transmission of COVID-19 variants. Travellers from Ontario will now be subject to the same COVID-19 restrictions as Quebec residents and a requirement that people travelling from Ontario to Quebec to return to their primary residence quarantine for 14 days has been lifted. — The Canadian Press 8 a.m. – Delta variant doubles risk of hospitalization in study People infected with COVID-19’s delta variant, first detected in India, are more than twice as likely to end up in the hospital than with the alpha variant identified in the U.K. last year. Vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca protect against delta, researchers said Monday. They found the shot made by Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE offered better protection in a large study from Scotland. The findings, presented in a research letter published in The Lancet, come as U.K. officials wrestle with whether to delay a lift in pandemic restrictions as the delta variant spreads. “We need to encourage everyone to come forward and take up their offer of vaccination to ensure that they’ve had both of their doses,” Jim McMenamin, the COVID-19 incident director at Public Health Scotland, said at a media briefing. Researchers from the Universities of Edinburgh and Strathclyde, as well as Public Health Scotland, found that the Pfizer vaccine offered 92 per cent protection against the alpha variant and 79 per cent against the delta one 14 days after the second dose. That compared with 73 per cent and 60 per cent protection for the Astra vaccine. The authors warned that the vaccine comparison should be interpreted with caution due to the observational nature of the data. – Bloomberg 6 a.m. –Entering post-COVID world sparks anxiety for some, but uneasiness is normal reaction: experts Our fear of contracting COVID-19 may be at its lowest level since the pandemic began in earnest, but when Maru Public Opinion asked a sample of Canadians what they believe is going to stick after COVID fully recedes, many said they intend to wash their hands more, avoid large crowds more, and vacation within driving distance more often rather than flying. They were less enamoured than before COVID with buffets, cruise ships, getting on a subway or bus, “working in an office with colleagues close by” or going out with someone they don’t know particularly well. After fifteen months of rolling lockdowns and lifts, some reopening skittishness is normal. Move people from high alert (danger!) to good to sort-of-go again, and “it’s going to take some time for you to get comfortable again,” said Dr. Thomas Ungar, psychiatrist-in-chief at Toronto’s St. Michael’s Hospital. Canadians have experienced a real, existential threat to their lives and way of living. Thousands are grieving the loss of loved ones or livelihoods. “Most of us have felt some sadness, anxiety, frustration, boredom, worry,” Ungar said, all of which are appropriate for one of the worst respiratory pandemics of the last 100 years. — National Post 12 a.m. –Canada to receive 9.5M vaccine doses this week thanks to influx of Moderna shots Canada is poised to receive around 9.5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses this week thanks to a massive infusion of shots from Moderna. The federal government says the Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical firm will deliver a total of 7.1 million jabs in two separate shipments this week. The first shipment of 2.9 million doses is scheduled to arrive and be sent to provinces in the middle of the week. The remaining 4.2 million will arrive later in the week, but won’t be sent to provinces and territories until next week. Another 2.4 million doses are also due to come from Pfizer and BioNTech, which have been consistently delivering large weekly shipments since mid-March. The shipments expected over the next seven days will more than double the number of shots Moderna has sent Canada’s way. The company had only delivered 6.2 million by the end of last week, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. — The Canadian Press 12 a.m. –B.C. set to lift more restrictions on Tuesday.

55,"Jun 10, 2021","She recorded and toured with Duke Ellington, hobnobbed with Miles Davis and Ella Fitzgerald, and now she’s got a regular gig playing at Eve’s Cafe, a weekly jazz concert put on byEve Dukeat St. Vincent’s Langara care home. Duke’s 96-year-old fingers glide over the keys of the grand piano in the atrium, her voice is still strong and beautiful. “I still got it,” she said with her trademark laugh. “She sure does,” added her percussionist, fellow resident Paul Adams. Her bass player isWendy Solloway, a jazz specialist hired just to play with Duke once a week. “Eve was asking about a bass player and I happened to show up at that time, looking for some casual work,” said Solloway. “I think we were a little skeptical of each other at first, Eve was doubtful a woman could fill the position (playing a standing bass), and Eve’s reputation kind of preceded her, this real diva and everything, so we were wary of each other. “But we made an immediate connection, both musically and on a personal level, and we now get on like a house on fire.” Besides touring with Ellington from 1950-52, she sang on three recordings:Sophisticated Lady,Mood IndigoandLove You Madlyunder the name Yvonne Lanauze. While she doesn’t think much of her own piano playing, claiming she’s a singer who happens to play, she is far too modest because her chops were brilliant at Eve’s Cafe on Thursday. She has a list of songs she’s familiar with and pretty much sticks to them, but when she does forget a line, she just makes up lyrics. “She never misses a beat, both figuratively and literally, and I just cherish the time we have together, she is lovely,” Solloway said. The facility put out a video calledDon’t Give Up the Shipin honour of B.C. Seniors Week and dedicated it to staff at St. Paul’s Hospital. While Duke’s short-term memory prevented her from taking part in the singing, she reads the introduction and helped come up with some of the lyrics. “I had to find a unique way of getting some lyrics out of her,” saidLucy Thomas, the music therapist at the home. She wound up beginning a lyric and Duke would finish it. “I’d throw a line at her and ask, ‘What comes after this line?’ and she came up with some really creative things.” Like, following “The storm is coming to an end,” with, “There’s a rainbow shining over you.” She thought she would teach school after graduating from Howard University but then heard Ellington, like her a native of Washington, D.C., was looking for a singer so she approached him to audition. He obviously liked what he heard. “He said, ‘What are you doing tonight?’ and she was onstage a few hours later with the band at the legendaryBohemian Caverns. But a life of touring wore her out and she wound up settling in Vancouver, where she met and married award-winning director and producerDaryl Duke, and performed in jazz combos around the city. She’s been at St. Vincent’s Langara for six years. “She has a lot of charisma,” Solloway said. “And music just seeps out of her cells.” gordmcintyre@postmedia.com twitter.com/gordmcintyre"
56,"Jun 06, 2021","Spending choices really do shape the world we live in. We have seen bottled water and toilet paper shortages, not to mention a shortage on cleaners, hand sanitizers and face masks with the fear-based buying fuelled by COVID. There really is no actual need to hoard products at this point but nonetheless it is hard not to feel the pressure to do so when you see others doing it. It goes without saying that we really need to cut back on paid services and just try to do more things for ourselves. The pandemic has essentially made us rethink our need to always have someone else do things for us and helped most of us get back to the basics. Yes — I know we still want to support all our local businesses — but that doesn’t mean you need to order takeout every night. Consider some of these savings tips and challenge yourself to come up with more. Think about how you spend your money every day and how you could make a difference that not only keeps the money in your wallet, but also helps the environment by being a little more “green.” • Stop buying new clothing and household items. Adopt a more “vintage” and eclectic style. Visit thrift stores (when they reopen). They offer fabulous items at a great price for items that can be “re-homed” and kept out of the landfill. • Drive your car longer. Have regular maintenance and repairs done instead of trading it in just because the mileage is high or you have lost interest in it. Why not make new seat covers for it and get it professionally painted? Voila — a new car! • Think about what you eat and drink. Limit the specialty drinks and expensive snacks — your wallet and your waistline will thank you! Why not start a garden and learn to freeze and can your fruits and vegetables? • Try to cut back the amount you spend on your pets.

57,,"A friend, who lives in a lovely little house with a garden, recently lost her husband. She is bereft, but is also strong and independent, and those of us who know her know she will be just fine even as she mourns the huge change that has come to her life. That said, she is in her early 80s, and now finds herself fielding the inevitable questions from family and friends, questions that often come to the newly widowed in the wake of heartfelt condolences. “What will you do now?” “How will you look after this place by yourself?” “Won’t you be lonely?” And this: “Have you thought about selling and moving into a condo, or a seniors’ residence, where you will have lots of company and no maintenance.” To which she answers: “I don’t know just yet. I will handle it. Yes, I will be lonely.” And, “hell no.” It is that last bit, then, that eventually comes to all of us who have been blessed to have spent decades in the single-family home, a house that is now mostly empty, as children have moved on, as spouses are outlived and as we grow less fond of untended vegetable patches and dusty unused rooms. But still we carry on, rattling around the place, fretting about the longevity of hot water tanks and asphalt roofs, worrying about falling down all those stairs, and hiring people to do the things we once enjoyed but now detest, like lawn mowing and window cleaning. We’ll even admit to ourselves and others that the notion of condo life, and downsizing, has its charms, but we stay put nonetheless, preferring the familiar over the foreign. And yet the refrain is relentless, especially for those of us in big cities where real estate prices are sky high: “Why don’t you take the money and run?” The answer, often, is: “To where?” And: “No thanks, I’m happy here and until I’m not happy here, I will stay here.” What is seldom discussed in these conversations is the symbolism of such a move. To downsize after a lifetime in one house, to up stakes from roomy square footage to a small condo or one room in a senior’s residence or a suite in an offspring’s house, is an unsettling milestone. It signals a major sea change in one’s station and capabilities, an unspoken acknowledgment of declining physical vitality, increasing mental fragility and more dependency. It means your old knees now ache by noon, and that your back is no longer happy to plant seeds and pull weeds, and that as much as you love cooking, there is no one around to taste test your talent with spices. It means calling on your children, if you are lucky to have them nearby, to help move furniture and repair broken appliances. Leaving the family home, by circumstance or choice, also carries with it the unholy notion that death is around the corner, that neither the financial gain nor the communal security of moving on can diminish the reality that growing old is not for the timid. Mostly, though, it’s about reconciling that what we leave behind is more than a building. What it’s about is the laughter of our kids running through the sprinkler in the back yard, the raucous wrapping-paper chaos on Christmas morning, the welcoming shade of the sapling that grew into a leafy giant, those creaky wood floors, the cherished pets interred in the little cemetery by the garage, the view from the dining room window, the moss-covered playhouse the late father built for the daughter, the wonderful neighbours and our front porches, the carport where a teenage boy hand-painted an old BMW. This is the house that will always be your home, no matter where you go, the physical vault that is the echo chamber of your life. And that, by its very human nature, makes it hard to let go. — Shelley Fralic writes the Life in the 60s column.shelleyfralic@gmail.com"
58,,"The COVID-19 pandemic has convinced more family members than ever of the importance of having a recognized voice in long-term care, according to the head of the province’s only regional family care association. Kim Slater, chairperson of theVancouver Island Association of Family Councils(VIAFC), said he’s 100 per cent in agreement with a late2020 recommendation by Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s seniors advocate, for the Ministry of Health to work with her office to create a provincewide association of family councils. “Family councils don’t want to make policy,” he said. “They do want to be involved in the discussion of policy so they can provide their insight and experience so that the policies that we come up with are good for residents.” Membership in family councils typically includes family care-givers and residents in a care home. While most of the province’s 293 long-term care homes have a family council, they can vary from independent, elected councils to ones operated by individual care homes. Slater said a recentstory in The Vancouver Sunabout family councils “exposed the tip of a very large iceberg.” “During the pandemic, people have been frightened at the vulnerability of their family member and how decisions were being made in long-term care,” he said from Lantzville on Vancouver Island. Slater said he’s been contacted by independent family councils in all B.C. health authorities — Vancouver Coastal Health, Fraser Health, Northern Health and Interior Health — who want a “guaranteed voice in the decisions that are being made in individual facilities, in health authorities, and within the Ministry of Health. “This has to be better. We have to have a way to network provincially so everyone is not operating in silos.” Slater said the VIAFC has family council members from 13 municipalities in Vancouver Island Health, the regional health authority for Vancouver Island. His involvement with family councils started when his mother went into a home in nearby Nanaimo around 2008. His family council was so active it was one of the ones contacted by Ombudsperson Kim S. Carter when she was researching her2009 report on long-term carethat included recommendations on the importance of creating family councils in maintaining the quality of care of residents. When Slater linked up with people in a similar situation in long-term care facilities in Victoria, he realized that his concerns were shared by others. “To gain more authenticity, we organized a regional association of family councils,” he said. “There hadn’t been one in B.C. before and still isn’t one besides us.” Slater said that initially he thought, perhaps naively, that the Ministry of Health would use the association as a resource. “It didn’t turn out that way,” he said. “Time after time, they had these great initiatives that included every other stakeholder except the very people sending people into long-term care and paying the bills.” When long-term care facilities were closed due to COVID-19, many people in the industry came to realize how important family members were in providing practical, day-to-day help to residents. When a family member helps with tasks such as eating and personal grooming, for example, care aides can focus on residents who don’t have family members to help them. Slater said some long-term care facilities do recognize the importance of independent family councils. Others, he said, don’t, and go to the extent of ignoring or marginalizing them. “Managers can do it in a variety of ways,” he said. “They’ll refuse to advertise meetings for independent family councils. They’ll tear down posters that are put up by family members to meet as a council.” He said when some long-term care facilities control the family councils and set the agenda as well as chair meetings, it has the effect of “stifling really important conversations often coming from elderly people who are afraid to complain.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com Start your day with a roundup of B.C.-focused news and opinion delivered straight to your inbox at 7 a.m., Monday to Friday by subscribing to ourSunrise newsletter here.

59,"May 25, 2021","A majority of family members were satisfied with how long-term care homes have operated during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an Angus Reid Institute poll released today. The poll was taken to get the views of family members closest to residents after Canadians were “very, very horrified” of stories coming out of long-term care homes over the past 15 months, said Angus Reid president Shachi Kurl. About two-thirds of all COVID-19 deaths in Canada have occurred in long-term care homes. The poll found that 39 per cent of those with loved ones in a long-term care home said the facilities handled the response to the pandemic as well as “could be expected” and 42 per cent said the homes performed “well enough overall.” The remaining 19 per cent said the long-term care homes had failed in their duties. The 800 respondents also said it would be impossible to care for their aged relatives at home (31 per cent) or would need considerable help (45 per cent) to do that. The survey found family members with loved ones in smaller, privately run facilities are less likely to offer a negative opinion of the facility, said Kurl. For instance, about one-third who have or had loved ones in government-run homes or those run by large corporations had significant concerns about staffing levels. That percentage for those whose loved ones live or lived in smaller independent homes was halved, the survey showed. “I’m not really surprised,” said B.C. Care Providers Association CEO Terry Lake. “That tends to be a communications or a relationship issue. It’s human nature that smaller and more intimate organizations are better at communicating with the family. This is where they really shine.” The larger homes “should look to do a better job” at explaining care and protocols to family members and being more transparent and forthcoming, he said. But he noted larger corporations can offer “more benefits” for residents, such as medical experts and greater resources. Lake said the staffing shortage that existed before COVID-19, in an industry where health care aides are paid $23 to $25 an hour, is challenging and he said the solution may lie in making it easier to allow immigration to fill the roles because Canadians aren’t attracted to the industry."
60,"May 24, 2021","B.C.’s younger residents appear to be getting vaccinated against COVID-19 at rates similar to their older counterparts, a phenomenon that bucks trends seen in other provinces and fills at least one medical expert with optimism for the eventual success of the province’s immunization campaign. Data from the Ministry of Health shows more than 63 per cent of eligible residents between the ages of 18 to 79 had registered to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as of May 18, the last date for which figures were available. The data comes as a breath of fresh air for Dr. Matthew Chow, president of the Doctors of B.C., which represents thousands of physicians in the province. He said unlike other provinces and territories, B.C. isn’t seeing a typical drop in registration in younger age groups. “When you look out to other jurisdictions, as you start to decrease the age cohort — you do tend to see fewer people uptaking the vaccine ,” Chow said. “But in B.C., so far so good.” Data as of May 18 shows more than 58 per cent of eligible residents in the 18-24 and 25-29 age groups have registered for a vaccine, with that figure climbing above 60 per cent for those aged 30-34 and 35-39. That has not always been the case, either in Canada or farther afield. Quebec’s health minister said Saturday that while initial demand for COVID-19 vaccination was initially strong among teens, the uptake appears to have slowed in the 18 to 44 age group. Christian Dube said that group was falling short of meeting the province’s target of having 75 per cent of its population making an appointment or receiving a first shot. Yukon Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley began urging younger residents to get vaccinated as far back as March, voicing concerns about the number of young people who hadn’t registered for an initial dose. “As we drop from the 70-plus age category, the per cent vaccinated drops with every decade,” he said at the time. “What we are seeing are trends where we have higher vaccine uptake with older age groups, and I think that’s not an uncommon phenomenon, looking at other areas. We tend to have, I think, a little more hesitancy among the younger groups.” He cited a range of reasons for younger residents to pass up vaccination opportunities, such as work and family commitments. The territory is now looking to lift large parts of its health restrictions on Tuesday, a move Hanley attributed in part to the success of its vaccination efforts. Health officials in the United States have also encouraged younger residents to get a shot without delay and do their part to build herd immunity. Despite the strong numbers in B.C., some public health units are directly targeting younger residents in their efforts to get people vaccinated. The Fraser Health authority launched an ad campaign specifically targeting young adults on Friday, a move Chow described as “proactive.” “It’s wise to just get ahead of this, get as many people vaccinated as possible, be really, really aggressive about getting it out to young people as well and we can look forward to a much, much better summer and fall,” he said. Chow said health authorities have also learned valuable lessons about outreach in certain cultural communities through the vaccination effort. “We needed better reach out into certain communities, certain language groups, religious communities,” he said. In places like Surrey, vaccination clinics are now being held in gurdwaras — places of worship for members of the Sikh community — which has helped, Chow added. B.C. announced plans on Thursday to vaccinate youth aged 12 to 17 against COVID-19 at community clinics. The province is alsoexpected to announce its plan to lift certain health restrictionson Tuesday.

61,"May 22, 2021","If there’s an indirect benefit of COVID-19 in long-term care, it’s been in highlighting the importance of family members in providing care to loved ones. In fact, describing what family members do only as visiting doesn’t fully capture what that can involve. Sometimes, it’s a simple human connection with a parent or spouse. For other family members, it can also mean practical help with day-to-day tasks such as eating and personal grooming. David Hurford, chief executive officer at theThree Links Care Society, thinks that what family members do could be recognized as part of the care team. “If a care aid was doing it, we’d measure it,” he said over the phone. “Take the family out of the equation and you notice the workload increase on the care aid.” About 90 residents live in theThree Linkscare centre in the Renfrew-Collingwood neighbourhood of Vancouver. Hurford thinks more needs to be done to recognize the importance of family members in improving the quality-of-life for residents. He said there has been at times a lack of imagination in long-term care. “I think this should open our eyes to the idea that we’re underutilizing this incredible resource of family care providers in the long-term care sector and finding a way to maybe make them formally part of the care team — if they want to,” he said. Seniors advocateIsobel Mackenzie said that while the pandemic has shown the importance of family members in providing care, the system hasn’t been able to recognize the degree to which some family members function as care partners. “We saw that when we shut out the visitors and heard the outcry and how distressed they were and saw the evidence out of the care homes in the increased use of antipsychotics to control behaviour,” she said. “That person was clearly really important to their quality of life on a day-to-day basis. It’s not everybody. It’s that group of residents and family members who are very involved with each other who were torn apart by the pandemic.” Mackenzie said one way to recognize the importance of family caregivers is to strengthen family and resident councils by giving them a collective voice similar to what unions, professional associations and care homes already have. In areport about the effects of visiting restrictions in long-term carereleased in November 2020, Mackenzie recommended that the Ministry of Health work with the Office of the Seniors Advocate to create a provincial organization for family caregivers. “There’s no ability for these family councils to raise their concerns or issues with the health authority or to the provincial level,” Mackenzie said. “The next step we need to take is to have a provincial voice that reflects the resident and family councils in each care home.” At Three Links, Joan Peacock is chairwoman of the six-member Family Advisory Council. Unlike other family members on the council who help a parent or wife or husband living in Three Links, Peacock provides help for her daughter. She estimated she visited her daughter Cindy about three times a week before the pandemic. “I would just take her out and push her in her wheelchair around the block and take her to medical appointments,” she said Once COVID-19 started, she was able to keep in touch with her daughter regularly by phone. More recently, she’s been declared an essential visitor so she’s been able to see her daughter again on a regular basis. “I have been told by several people how much happier they are now that they’re able to see family members in-person and go outside,” Peacock said. Family councils said to improve well-being of care residents “Resident and family councils,” a B.C.ombudsperson report saidin 2009, “are important mechanisms for ensuring the well-being of residents in residential care facilities.” Family councils, the report said, help residents overcome isolation and give them greater influence over the conditions where they live — an institution that is also their home. The report recommended that there should be a liaison person at each facility as well as in each health authority to help with and respond to the councils. As well, the province should create a position to help develop the councils and report on their activities annually. ”The formation of regional family council organizations could serve as a needed early warning system … by allowing family councils to identify common, and perhaps systemic, problems before they become crises,” Ombudsperson Kim S. Carter saidin the report. In thelast updatein June 2015, the ombudsperson reported guidelines had been sent to long-term care operators but nothing further had been done in implementing the recommendations. (An estimated 250 of 300 care homes now have some form of family council.) “No progress; no further action,” the update said. In December 2020, the seniors advocate said in the surveyFrom Staying Apart to Stay Safethat the way COVID-19 visitor restrictions were developed and implemented “revealed a lack of voice for residents and family members in the decision-making process … ” She called on the Ministry of Health to work with the Office of the Seniors Advocate to create a provincewide association representing the interests of care residents and family members. “The association would bring to the table the voice of residents and their family members in equal measure with those who own and operate care homes and the staff who work there,” thesurvey said. kevingriffin@postmedia.com Get the latest COVID-19 news delivered to your inbox weeknights at 7 p.m. bysubscribing to our newsletter here."
62,"May 02, 2021","Vancouver, he is back; to his city by the sea he is back, he is back. The words, with the pronouns altered slightly, are Jack Roche’s, lyrics to the first song he’s ever written (but not the last, he promises). He is 91, and is feeling revitalized. Roche was admitted to theSt. John Hospiceat the University of B.C. in November because ofpulmonary fibrosis, He was terribly sick and weak, and not expected to have long to live. His family — wife Gail, daughter Jenny, son Tom and daughter-in-law Naz — readied themselves for the worst. They could never have expected to see the animation and joy on his face as Josh Denny-Keys, the music therapist forProvidence Health Care, sat beside him with his guitar and sang, via Zoom, the song Roche wrote. Hospice care is often misunderstood, Roche said. When asked if his stay at St. John has reinvigorated him, he answered with a resounding “Yes, 100 per cent!” before the question was even finished. He compared the care he’s getting at the hospice with living in a five-star resort. “It can actually be an energizing, positive experience for some people,” Denny-Keys said, adding he has seen some patients gain a new sense of purpose. Born in 1930, Roche grew up in Toronto and visited Vancouver for the first time in 1958. It was love at first site and he moved to the city for good in 1964 (living in a float shack in Coal Harbour in the beginning). Roche was mostly a pipefitter. Joining UA 170, the plumbers’ union, was the second-best thing he ever did, he said; the best was marrying his wife Gail, who retired as head registered nurse at the GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre. But being resourceful and resilient, Roche also reinvented himself many times over. He had been a dairy farmer, tobacco picker, fisherman, diamond driller, and logger, working as far afield as Inuvik, Labrador, and Trinidad and Tobago. He’s also a good teller of jokes. So in a way, Tom’s dad writing the lyrics for a song to express gratitude for health, improved spirits and the care at St. John Hospice wasn’t too much of a surprise. And Roche is a music-lover, with tastes that range from opera to blues and jazz. Having trouble sleeping, he began listening to Frank Sinatra sing New York, New York, among other songs, and it’s that Ol’ Blue Eyes standard (along with Don’t Cry for me Argentina) that inspired him to write about the city he loves and calls home. He awoke one day in early April and jotted down the lyrics, wanting mainly to thank everyone at St. John Hospice. When staff read his lyrics, nurse Kelly Konyk, the site coordinator at the hospice, got in touch with Denny-Keys to set the words to music. Roche made it clear he didn’t want something too sentimental and Denny-Keys said the lyrics made it easy to write the pleasing melody. “It took about a half-an-hour,” he said. You canlisten to his song online:“As I gaze out the window, here at my final home, the warm and loving St. John Hospice, where the river meets the sea, Vancouver, this is where I’m meant to be.” gordmcintyre@postmedia.com twitter.com/gordmcintyre"
63,"Apr 30, 2021","TORONTO — Ontario’s neglected long-term care sector needs sweeping reforms to protect its vulnerable residents, an independent commission has found, pointing the finger in a scathing report at governments past and present for thousands of COVID-19 deaths at the province’s nursing homes. Despite numerous past reviews, commissions and inquiries recommending improvements, the sector was completely unprepared for the pandemic, the Long-Term Care COVID-19 Commission said in a 322-page report delivered to the provincial government on Friday night. “Many of the challenges that had festered in the long-term care sector for decades — chronic underfunding, severe staffing shortages, outdated infrastructure and poor oversight — contributed to deadly consequences for Ontario’s most vulnerable citizens during the pandemic,” the commissioners wrote. The province failed to learn from the SARS epidemic in 2003 and should heed expert advice this time around, they said. “Now is the time to revisit the delivery model for long-term care and adopt a better way to provide care for Ontario’s seniors,” the report said. Nearly 4,000 long-term care residents and 11 staff have died of COVID-19 since the pandemic hit. Poor facility design and resident overcrowding heightened sickness and death in the nursing homes, the commission found. A severe staffing shortage and a workforce poorly trained in infection control measures compounded the situation, it said. New facilities need to be built to address the needs of the province’s aging population, the commission said, adding that the government also needs to reconsider how those nursing homes are managed, with a focus on quality care. It suggested a new model to build long-term care homes in the future, similar to what’s in place for privately funded hospitals, courthouses and light rail transit systems. “All involve the construction of infrastructure that is paid for upfront by private investors who receive a return on their capital with profit over time. However, others actually operate the infrastructure — the courts, hospitals, etc. — once built,” the report said. Then, the commission suggests, a mission-driven organization — be it public, not-for-profit or for-profit — would handle the care of the residents. The commission took particular issue with long-term care homes that are owned by investors. “Care should be the sole focus of the entities responsible for long-term care homes,” it said. It also suggested that the provincial government — and Dr. David Williams, the chief medical officer of health, in particular — was too slow to act on emerging information about COVID-19. The province was hesitant to acknowledge that community spread was happening, that asymptomatic patients could spread the virus and that masks would be helpful when it comes to prevention. “Delay is deadly,” the commissioners wrote. Ontario launched the commission on May 19, 2020, in an effort to determine what went wrong in long-term care homes during the pandemic’s first wave. At that time, long-term care residents accounted for nearly 1,400 of the province’s 1,904 COVID-19 deaths. Five staff members had also died of COVID-19 at that point. But even after the commission was launched — and after it released two interim sets of recommendations — the virus continued to tear through the facilities. The commission, led by Frank Marrocco, associate chief justice of the Superior Court, heard from long-term care residents, staff and management. It questioned government officials from Williams to Long-Term Care Minister Merrilee Fullerton to Health Minister Christine Elliott. Military leaders who organized a deployment into long-term care homes also gave testimony, detailing the circumstances surrounding the mission that led to a damning report on conditions inside the facilities. In all, the report said, the commission heard from more than 700 people."
64,"Apr 28, 2021","A rush on the AstraZeneca vaccine after B.C. opened up supply to those 40-and-older made it difficult for people like Catherine Hopkins from even getting on a waiting list for her COVID-19 jab. Hopkins, 54, tried to book at a number of pharmacies, the day her cohort was allowed to step up for AstraZeneca. “Most were online booking only and were fully booked,” she said. Even though she had called a pharmacy close to her work in the Kensington area with no luck, she decided to go in-person to increase her odds and chose a smaller independent drugstore that might not be as busy as the larger chains, a strategy she had read about online. Hopkins was told they had had some spots in the morning but were all booked, and they offered her the waiting list. “I saw him write my name on a pad of paper and I didn’t think it would work,” she said. “But I told him I worked in the area” and could get there quickly if there was a cancellation. She got a call at 3 p.m. and got her jab at 5:10 p.m. right after work last Tuesday. “I feel lucky,” she said. “I have other friends who are still waiting for theirs.” B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said all 314,000 doses of AstraZeneca, which was made available first to those between 55 and 64 years old and then to those 40 to 64, were expected to be gone, and no new doses are expected this week. Pharmacies are currently administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to those age 40 and older, although the age eligibility is expected to drop when more doses arrive in B.C. In some areas hard-hit by COVID-19, Fraser Health has lowered the eligibility age to 30-and-over. Two pop-up clinics in Surrey and Coquitlam on Tuesday drew long lines of people unfazed by the wait. Shots at the pop-up clinics were only available to people with eligible postal codes who live in high-transmission neighbourhoods in the Fraser Valley. Fraser Health said it was pleased with the turnout, and hope to set up more drop-in clinics if the supply is available. “We are hoping to provide more notification regarding our drop-in clinics going forward but we don’t want to miss any opportunities to expand a clinic when we can,” said the health authority in a statement. “We will implement further drop-in opportunities where and when we can.” 1of 15 You may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen. According to the health ministry, B.C. has received 314,700 doses of AstraZeneca and administered 201,419 doses, which would leave a stockpile of more than 110,000, although the ministry noted there is a lag in reporting from pharmacies. The province’s limited supply of AstraZeneca is being used to target “hot spot” communities, said B.C. provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix in a joint statement. “We know demand for the AstraZeneca vaccine is high in many areas. Unfortunately, available supply through pharmacies in some regions will continue to be limited until additional supplies come in.” The supply of Moderna has been delayed by news that the number of doses Canada was to receive by the end of April was cut about in half to 650,000 from the expected 1.2 million. But B.C. was expecting a shipment of almost 275,000 Pfizer doses, and it would be receiving some of the 300,000 doses of Johnson & Johnson announced for Canada on Monday. “We should expect to receive them (the Johnson & Johnson vaccines) next week,” said Henry. The U.S. said it would be distributing to other countries 60 million doses of AstraZeneca, and B.C. Premier John Horgan on Tuesday said he would be discussing a “range of border-type issues” with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee this week on one of their regular calls to try to secure some of those shots. “If we had more supply, we’d have more people vaccinated,” he said. Every British Columbian that wanted a vaccine should receive one over the next two months, Henry said. If B.C. receives more vaccines it “might be ahead of that time line,” said Henry. The B.C. Pharmacy Association on its website Friday asked people seeking their jab not to call pharmacies because “no appointments are available at this time” at the 640 pharmacies that Dix said were given AstraZeneca. It said the demand “has exceeded the current supply available in B.C. pharmacies” and said all AstraZeneca doses were expected to be given out this week. “Pharmacy supply in B.C. is allocated by the provincial government,” said pharmacies spokesman Michael Mui in an email. “Once we receive additional supply we will be happy to share more information.” Over 1.6 million British Columbians, or about 35 per cent of the population, have received their first doses and more than 89,000 two doses, said Dix. All British Columbians aged 18-and-older can now register online atgetvaccinated.gov.bc.ca, and those in their late 50s-and-older are getting contacted to make appointments for their Pfizer or Moderna shots. British Columbians who received a first dose of AstraZeneca at a pharmacy will have to register online for their second dose, beginning May 1. slazaruk@postmedia.com — with files from Cheryl Chan"
65,"Apr 20, 2021","Health care is always the biggest item in provincial budgets, but after a year living through a pandemic — when more than 1,500 people died from COVID, health-care workers were overwhelmed, and long-term care homes were hit hard — the NDP is promising to “build capacity” in a system that continues to struggle. The budget promises a $2.6 billion increase in health funding by 2023-24, to bring in “measures that support the safety of health care workers, long-term care residents and patients, and other targeted supports to seniors.” This includes: • $253 million to expand primary care and provide faster access to doctors and nurse practitioners • $300 million for cancer care, Pharmacare and other in-demand services • $495 million to reduce diagnostic imaging and surgery backlogs worsened by the pandemic. The budget also pledges $900 million in one-time funding for pandemic-related needs, such as providing vaccines, buying personal protection equipment and COVID screening services. There will be $45 million over three years to respond to recommendations in last fall’s In Plain Sight report, which found evidence of persistent,systemic racism against Indigenous patientsand staff in the health-care system. The money will be used for First Nations cultural training and education, ensuring Indigenous liaisons in every health authority, and hiring a more diverse workforce. Nearly $8 billion has been committed over three years for health care infrastructure, including the new St. Paul’s and Surrey hospitals, and a new patient care tower at Burnaby Hospital. Michael Sandler of the Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of B.C. would have liked the budget to include more money “to address the shortage of nurses … especially in rural and remote communities, where nursing is generally the only resource available.” Kelli Stajduhar, a professor of nursing at the University of Victoria, said the budget did not contain enough details about how some key issues will be addressed, such as Pharmacare, the standards for long-term care homes and the “workforce crisis” in long-term care. “I think we are neglecting our older adults and the workforce that cares for them in this budget,” Stajduhar said. A disproportionate amount of B.C.’s COVID deaths happened in long-term care homes, and advocates have said this emphasizes the need for more funding toallow seniors to stay in their homes. In response, the budget earmarked $68 million to hire new care aides and other community providers to help seniors stay at home. There will also be $12 million over three years to support the use of Bluetooth-enabled devices that give blood pressure and other health updates, which are monitored by nurses. For those seniors in care facilities, the government has promised to maintain new rules that require staff to work at only one site to reduce infections. In addition, $585 million over three years is pegged to hire 3,000 new health care workers, which will include more staff for long-term and assisted-living facilities. Finance Minister Selina Robinson said there was also money to build more care facilities. “We have over 20 projects right now that are in planning, we’re going to be creating about 1,500 new beds,” she said. Terry Lake, of the B.C. Care Providers Association, said he welcomes the government’s spending on the long-term care homes he represents, including hiring new staff. But he said the number of new beds funded in the budget needs to be closer to 2,500 a year to keep up with future need. “It doesn’t recognize the true demand that’s going to happen as baby boomers start entering the period of their life when they’re going to need long-term care,” Lake said. While Christine Sorensen, president of the B.C. Nurses’ Union, applauds new health care spending, she worries they won’t be enough to meet demands as the pandemic continues. “We expected to see more attention paid to the incredible strain that’s occurring right now on the health-care system, and those working within it. Again, we see plans for new and upgraded health care facilities, but no mention of how they plan to staff them in the short and long term.” On Monday, the federal budget promised $3 billion over the next five years to help provinces implement new standards for long-term care homes, to try to avoid the deaths that occurred during the pandemic. lculbert@postmedia.com"
66,"Apr 19, 2021","At Surrey Memorial Hospital, the mannequins have more than a pulse. They also have a heartbeat and eyes that contract in response to light. They can say ‘Ow!’ if you don’t have the right touch with a needle. To reflect all the ethnicities at the hospital, the mannequins come in different skin colours from lighter to darker. There is a pediatric mannequin, a baby mannequin and a pregnant mom mannequin who can give birth. Although all the high-tech mannequins may sound like the makings of a movie set for a medical drama, they all play their different roles in simulations meant to mimic real-life hospital situations — including evolving COVID-19 treatment protocols. “Pretty much anything we would do with a person, we can almost accomplish with our mannequins,” said Lisa Ewart, clinical practice consultant and simulation program lead in Fraser Health. “When (medical staff) go out into the real environment, they can say, ‘We’ve practised this on simulation.’ It gives staff the knowledge and confidence to say, ‘We can do this.’ ” The Surrey Hospitals Foundation is investing $100,000 in new simulation technologies, part of its $1.3 million contribution to the lab since 2015. The new money will be used to buy a mannequin ‘skin’ for performing ultrasounds. As well, it will be used to add a simulated ventilator lung so a ventilator can be hooked up to a mannequin. “It can mimic different patient problems that we see with COVID-19,” she said. “It allows staff to figure out the best kind of care, and how to adapt current protocols and policies.” The foundation said in a news release that the lab performed 217 COVID-19 simulations and trained more than 900 hospital staff between March and June 2020. “We were doing back-to-back situations, working with front-line staff and providing opportunity to practise new processes and changes that were coming into effect at a rapid speed,” Ewart said. Since then, she estimated that about 90 per cent of all simulations are directly related to COVID-19. And the simulations have helped hospital staff learn how to communicate with one another while wearing full PPE, for example. “It is gives them a safe, risk-free environment to come in and practise a situation,” she said. The high-tech medical simulation at Surrey Memorial is the descendant of the original‘blue box’ simulation developed in 1929 for the aviation industry. Edwin A. Link made a blue box replica of the inside of an airplane cockpit that moved in a way similar to a real airplane to teach pilots how to fly. By the 1960s, mannequins were being used to practise mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. In 1968,Harvey, the Cardiology Patient Simulatormannequin, was developed at the Miami Medical School. At Surrey Memorial, Ewart said each simulation is based on a scenario or script about 15-minutes long. Each scenario includes details such as the patient’s personal and family history, medication use and the cause of the hospital visit. “It allows them to troubleshoot and consider all the possibilities, come up with a game plan and enact it,” she said. The lab is also mobile. Ewart said equipment can be taken to other departments such as intensive care to educate more hospital staff and give them experience in situations they normally aren’t exposed to. They can include trauma caused by a vehicle collision or a code blue, the term used to describe a medical emergency involving a cardiac or respiratory arrest. One of the most often practised simulations, she said, isintubating a seriously ill COVID-19patient. Intubating involves placing a tube into the patient’s mouth or nose through the windpipe; the tube is connected to a ventilator to help the patient breathe. The procedure is done in cases where SARS-CoV-2 has so damaged the lungs that they can’t expel carbon dioxide and provide enough oxygen. “I think that’s one we have practised over-and-over again,” she said. “The way we’ve been able to say that our program has been successful is through the stories we’ve heard from front-line staff who say, ‘We practised the situation and a few days later I was involved in the same situation and knew exactly what to do.’” kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
67,"Apr 14, 2021","A look at sales of buildings involving the current owner of Vancouver Grace Seniors Home to non-profit groups to build affordable housing reveals how low-income housing for Chinese seniors is being lost. There is high demand and long waitlists for housing and care options that cater to East Asians of all incomes, according to a 2017 study by social services agency S.U.C.C.E.S.S. and Simon Fraser University’s Gerontology Research Centre. But there is also more pressure to build new, affordable housing for other groups. B.C. Housing and its non-profit partner, Lu’Ma Native Housing Society, are now saying the approximately 70 seniors living at Vancouver Grace Seniors Home at 333 East Pender near Chinatown will have the choice to stay after it completes the purchase of the building, rather than have to scramble for new housing. A sale is currently under contract. The about-turn came after families of residents went public with their concerns about the future of the building. The current owner, Stephen Lee, informed them at the end of March that Grace would close byJune. He placed newspaper ads seeking to rent homes, buildings and large warehouses that could be possible relocation options for some, but not all the seniors. There is talk among families and their care workers that this isn’t the first such case. In 2007, Grace Christian Church sold a building at 596 East Hastings to the Salvation Army.The land title for that sale was signed by Lee. In order for the sale to happen, the City of Vancouver had to discharge a 2002 housing agreement it had for Grace’s existing building at 596 East Hastings so that the Salvation Army could develop low-income, social housing. There was concern by the city for the “security and well-being of the current seniors,” about half of whom qualified for B.C. Housing’s Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters subsidy. Grace was running the home on East Hastings for 46 Chinese seniors, but the building wasn’t fully used and Grace was reporting annual losses of $900,000, according to staff notes recommending city council approve the housing agreement change in November 2006. The Salvation Army got funding under the Provincial Homelessness Initiative and rent subsidies from B.C. Housing for a 35-year operating agreement “to provide social housing targeted to low-income people who are homeless, at risk of homelessness, and in need of second-stage housing.” It has since been runningSalvation Army Grace Mansion, a transitional home for 84 residents. A letter from the city to Lee in November 2006 noted his relocation plan then included the 46 seniors at 596 E Hastings moving to other senior homes he operated, including at the Vancouver Chinese Mennonite Church Senior Home at 485 Dunlevy and Vancouver Grace Seniors Home on East Pender, as well as Richmond Grace Seniors Home on Westminster Highway. In 2017, the building at 485 Dunlevy, which had 32 units where Chinese seniors were living, was sold to Atira Women’s Resource Society, which now runs a supportive housing building for women 45 and older. Some of the Chinese seniors moved down the street into Vancouver Grace Seniors Home. B.C. Minister of Housing David Eby said he would ensure seniors at 333 East Pender could stay. He said Lu’Ma, which is “particularly focused on the needs of urban Indigenous people,” and B.C. Housing would meet the seniors to identify their needs. They could likely procure services and staff to continue providing culturally appropriate meals and programming for those who choose to stay. But if those residents move out, housing units that specifically served low-income Chinese seniors will be lost, just as they were at the other locations on Hastings and Dunlevy when those buildings were sold to non-profit organizations. “I don’t think there’s an easy answer,” said Eby. He said collecting race-based data about the impact of housing decisions on groups such as Chinese seniors could help with future decision-making. He said the current deal for 333 East Pender was a federal purchase connected to the Rapid Housing Initiative funds, but added, “It really demonstrates the importance of when B.C. Housing becomes involved in a building purchase like this to ensure that we’re recognizing the cultural connections that housing has to a particular community.” jlee-young@postmedia.com"
68,"Apr 12, 2021","Almost 70 seniors at an assisted living home near Chinatown have got a reprieve as B.C. Housing said Sunday its non-profit partner, which has a pending deal to purchase the facility, will allow elderly residents to stay. This will bring some personal relief for families who had beenscramblingafter the owner of Vancouver Grace Seniors Home at 333 East Pender issued a letter last month saying it would close the facility at the end of May. However, there are still concerns about the sale and what it means for seniors at Grace. After getting the sudden notice Grace will close, its residents became worried after seeing the relocation choices being offered by the current owner. There was an ad placed in Chinese-language newspaper seeking to rent homes, a building or a “large warehouse space” to house 40 seniors, which gave them little confidence there was a well-crafted plan in progress. Another ad appeared this weekend offering room and board to staff willing to work at three homes elsewhere in south Vancouver and Richmond that the owner is hoping to lease. B.C. Housing said in its statement on Sunday it is “both frustrated and disappointed to learn about” the situation at Grace. It’s not clear why the housing agency wasn’t aware what the current owner and residents might face. Some use B.C. Housing’s Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters for low to moderate income renters to help pay the market rent at Grace. Most are in their late 80s and 90s, and about two-thirds use Vancouver Coastal Health’s home health services. For about three decades, Grace has filled the gap for seniors between living independently and moving into a long-term care home. B.C. Housing said its involvement in the sale includes “committing capital and operating funding for Lu’ma (Native Housing Society’s) purchase of the (333 E Pender) building, which is primarily funded through the (federal government’s)Rapid Housing Initiative,in order to retain much-needed affordable housing that would otherwise have been purchased by a private developer.” It said “B.C. Housing and Lu’ma are taking immediate steps to support residents at 333 Pender. Lu’ma has committed that anyone who wants to stay can do so.” 1of 13 You may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen. Even with that offer, Christina Lam, whose 90-year-old father Cheang Che Fu lives at Grace, and others are still questioning the sale of the building. Her dad, Fu, worked for almost 20 years as a general labourer for B.C. Ferries, cleaning cafeterias and loading luggage for walk-on passengers on longer routes. They are asking what the bigger picture means for seniors like him, and for others without pensions, who have been living in the area for a long time. “Even if my dad can stay in the building, why can’t it be kept as a care home for Chinese seniors,” said Lam. That would mean Grace would continue a long-standing offering that provides Chinese meals, staff who speak Cantonese, and programming that is tied to Chinatown’s businesses and cultural institutions, all things that are key to her dad and other seniors thriving, she said. “They need to maintain some staff and hire for continuity of programming,” said Lam’s cousin Catherine Eang. “It’s a place of 70 of them. All seniors like continuity.” “There is a distinct need and demand for more, not less culturally-responsive housing for Chinese seniors in the (area),” said Michael Tan, co-chair of the Vancouver Chinatown Legacy Stewardship Group, which was appointed by the City of Vancouver. “The seniors are the fabric of what makes Chinatown a community,” said Tan, adding they depend on the shops and services of the area as much as the future of the neighbourhood, as one with historic and working-class roots, depends on them and their families to support it. jlee-young@postmedia.com"
69,"Apr 09, 2021","Almost 70 seniors who live at an assisted living home near Chinatown, and the staff who care for them, have been told the home will close at the end of May. Families have been scrambling to find new accommodation for the seniors, some who are in their 90s and older. About two-thirds of them require health care visits from Vancouver Coastal Health. The property —Vancouver Grace Seniors Homeat 333 East Pender St. — has been sold to a non-profit partner working with B.C. Housing. The government’s housing agency said in a statement that the purchase has not closed yet. It toldPostmedia it has “built-in measures as a condition of the purchase negotiation to ensure all existing residents will have a relocation plan.” But the families of the residents said they have heard nothing of efforts that would allow the seniors to stay in the neighbourhood. Instead, they saw an ad placed in a Chinese-language newspaper by the co-owner of the building, seeking to quickly rent another building or a “large warehouse space” for 40 seniors while he begins the process of building a new seniors home on Renfrew Street at 1st Avenue. “We don’t know what’s happened,” said Christina Lam, whose father, Cheang Che Fu, 90, has been living at Grace since 2017. “All we can do is be inquisitive and really get to the bottom of what’s going on. We get this letter from the place and in my dad’s words, ‘the place has been sold. We’re getting kicked out.'” Community groups have long said there is a need for more “culturally responsive seniors housing” in Chinatown. Losing Grace will worsen the situation at a time when Chinatown has been hard hit by the pandemic, especially for seniors facing challenges gettingvaccinatedand worrying about the spike in racist attacks against Asian people. Lam said her dad appreciates the three Chinese meals a day, the Cantonese-speaking staff and programming, and being close to the shops and services of Chinatown where he has long lived. He isn’t a “social animal,” but Lam said her heart broke thinking about some of the other seniors, “especially the women,” who depend on living at Grace for community and to thrive. “The groups of ladies who watch Cantonese shows on TV and have afternoon tea. I seriously was just tearing up knowing they’re having to leave.” Fu has a pension from working for decades as a general labourer for B.C. Ferries, but many of the other residents use subsidies such as B.C. Housing’s Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters for low to moderate income seniors to help pay the market rent at Grace. The property at 333 East Pender is listed on land title as being owned by Parkco Enterprises Ltd. of which there are two directors, including Stephen Lee, a Burnaby-based pastor, who placed the ad. Lee confirmed the property is under contract to be sold. He said he is looking forward to building a new “seniors complex for the next generation” at 1742-1762 Renfrew, a property he has purchased that is also under contract. He said 18 of the seniors can move to another seniors home that he runs in Richmond. He is also planning to lease three detached houses, one in south Vancouver and two in Richmond, next week and “show them to the residents and their families and let them choose.” “Some of the others can also take their parents and go home,” said Lee, adding that Grace is a privately owned business. Relying on family members in a pinch may be possible for some residents, but some don’t have that option. “It’s a very panicked situation for most of us,” said Helen Kwan. Her mother-in-law and father-in- law, who are both 90, have lived at Grace since 2014. She’s reached out for help from social workers who have said it could be very hard to find supportive housing for them to stay together. B.C. Housing said it “negotiated a lengthy 90-day housing closing date so the current owner has time to become familiar with appropriate relocation requirements outlined by the City of Vancouver and the Residential Tenancy Branch, and update their relocation plan for existing tenants. And as the owner was looking to sell for some time, a tenant relocation strategy was already in process.” Families are also asking if Grace is being closed and sold as part of providing housing for homeless campers at Strathcona Park. It is a block away from the Patricia Hotel, which was recently purchased by B.C. Housing for that purpose. B.C. Housing said in a statement the building “will not be used to house people currently staying in Strathcona Park.” jlee-young@postmedia.com"
70,,"André Picard|Random House Canada (Toronto, 2021) $19.95 | 201pp. When news breaks about Canadian elders, the news is often very bad. As Globe and Mail journalist André Picard wryly notes in the introduction to his thoughtful, measured but nonetheless scathing indictment of how Canadians treat our aged, we most often hear about these forgotten elders when something dire occurs. Consider the lethal 2014 fire at Residence de Havre in L’Isle-Verte, Que., or the lurid murder trial of Ontario long-term care nurse Elizabeth Wettlaufer, convicted of killing eight patients. And those horrors occurred before the COVID pandemic scythed through Canada’s long-term care homes, leaving far too many seniors to suffer and die. COVID simply made an already bad situation far worse. For example, last year at the Residence Herron in Dorval, Que., when public health workers responded to a complaint, 13 of 15 staff had quit or fled. The remaining pair of workers were left to “care” for over 130 patients. By the end of the month, 31 patients had died. By September 2020, 82 per cent of Canada’s pandemic deaths had occurred in homes for the elderly, twice the average reported across the OECD. And while the current national vaccination campaign has properly focused on inoculating staff and residents in residences for the elderly, thus reducing COVID risks there, lethal outbreaks continue to occur. Early this year the prestigious Lancet magazine reported that 55 per cent of Canadian COVID deaths have occurred in long-term care residences. We have been failing in our duty to cherish and protect the elderly for a long time, and even absent the pandemic a case for a full reform of elder care in the country is compelling. Picard suggests that sweeping increases in staffing across the sector will be needed, with an end to the union busting by private-sector employers that has forced many health-care workers to “stack” several part-time jobs, none of which provide the benefits associated with full-time work. This pattern of precarious work from residence to residence clearly played a role in spreading COVID in long-term care facilities. Picard also argues that new facilities, smaller and less institutional, should be part of our elder-care reforms. Paid nurse navigator positions should be created, he says, to help patients and their families cope with the intricacies of the elder-care system. All his suggestions make sense. We should all hope and demand that he’ll be heeded. Highly recommended. Tom Sandborn lives and writes in Vancouver.

71,"Apr 07, 2021","Indigenous art by the first peoples of Metro Vancouver is expected to be part of a major public art program at thenew St. Paul’s Hospital. The program is made possible by a $4 million donation by theAudain Foundation, one of B.C.’s top philanthropic organizations. Michael Audain, chair of the board of the foundation, said Wednesday that he supports art in public places because art has a role to play outside of art museums and the homes of art patrons. “Art is probably best when it can be viewed free of charge at any time by the public,” Audain said. St. Paul’s said in a news release that its public art program will be developed with the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh, “as well as informed by Indigenous patients and urban Indigenous peoples.” Audain and his wife Yoshi Karasawa think the donation will help integrate Indigenous art into the new hospital project. “We like the idea that the hospital wants to focus on Northwest coast art because they serve a great many Indigenous people,” Audain said. “I think it would be great when Indigenous people come to the hospital if there is some art by their leading artists that they recognize and makes them feel more like home.” Helping with the hospital’s public art program isDaina Augaitiswho is on the board of the Audain Foundation. Augaitis worked at the Vancouver Art Gallery for 20 years as the associate director and chief curator. “I’m certainly going to leave it up to her to work with the hospital to determine the program,” Audain said. The donation creates what is described as the biggest public art project of its kind at a health care site in the country. Thenew St. Paul’s Hospital at the Jim Pattison Medical Centreis located on a 7.4 ha (18.4-acre) site in east Vancouver’s False Creek Flats. The hospital at 1002 Station Street will be part of a complex of buildings dedicated to health care, life sciences, research, technology, and innovation. Construction on the project which has increased to almost $2.2 billion is expected to be completed in 2026 with the new hospital ready for patients in 2027. Broek Bosma, chief development officer for the St. Paul’s Foundation he expects the project will start working with a public art consultant within six months. He said the project’s public art committee will be looking not just at the hospital but at the whole site. “My guess is that it will be multiple pieces throughout the campus that will really bring it alive,” he said. St. Paul’s said in a news release that public art at the new hospital site “is expected to reflect Providence Health Care’s mission of service to all, its inclusive Catholic identity, and specifically its commitment to reconciliation.” Bosma said with the Audain Foundation gift, St. Paul’s has raised more than $200 million toward its goal of $225 million. He said now the foundation is looking to raise even more money for other buildings on the site such as a research centre. An announcement is expected soon on a second fundraising phase of more than $100 million. “We’re so grateful to our donors and to Michael for this amazing and transformative gift,” Bosma said. kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
72,"Apr 06, 2021","A suicide-prevention program that started out as an initiative led by experts turned into something quite different once it involved theStó:lō Nationin the Fraser Valley. In fact, the approach was so effective, the Stó:lō have taken it over and are now running it themselves. Alanaise Goodwilldoesn’t call what she has been involved with a “program.” She describes it as a project that expanded to include a web of relationships embedded in traditional Sto:lō language, culture, and land. “We thought that if we can create a process for Stó:lō kids to not only go on these beautiful hikes in their traditional territory but also do it in a way where they increase their capacity to describe who they are and what their land is and what their responsibilities are, their well-being should go up,” said Goodwill, one of the few registered Indigenous psychologists in B.C. “We should be preventing suicide.” Goodwill was a co-investigator with the project funded by theCanadian Institutes of Health Research,Institute of Indigenous People’s Health, which ran from 2017 to 2019. She is an assistant professor in education at Simon Fraser University, and said she is speaking about her own experience with the project, not on behalf of the Stó:lō. Goodwill is a member of the Sandy Bay Ojibway First Nation and was born and raised on Stó:lō territory.S’olh Temexw, or traditional Stó:lō territory, extends from Langley to Yale. Goodwill estimated that of about 100 people a year who participated in the project, 20 to 30 were youths aged 12 to 18, and the remainder included some children as well as adults and elders. The project included a number of land-based activities such as hiking and canoeing. One of the most popular was sleeping overnight in a smokehouse, a Stó:lō traditional spiritual structure. “When they would go on these hikes, they would learn the sacred geography — the stories that are thousands of years old that go with the land,” Goodwill said. Wherever possible, the traditional Sto:lō language ofHalq’emeylemwas used for names, places, and activities. Although Halq’emeylem is a critically endangered language with only four fluent speakers remaining, the Stó:lō are actively working to revive the language. During the course of the project, there were no completed suicides by young people in the Stó:lō communities involved, Goodwill said. In 2017, a federal report on Indigenous suicide found that when First Nations increase their control over social and economic services as well as retain use of their Indigenous language, it results in lower overall rates of suicide. Breaking Point: The Suicide Crisis in Indigenous Communitiespointed out that suicide rates are not uniform in Indigenous communities across the country. It said that in B.C., the “majority of First Nations have low or no incidence of suicide, while a small number of First Nations have very high rates of suicide.” “We’re figuring out how to decolonize access to our own land and land-based teaching and (how to) put a set of practices in place in the contemporary context of Canada so that it becomes more accessible to Indigenous youth, Stó:lō youth specifically,” Goodwill said. “Once we start to troubleshoot these barriers and create a process that’s sustainable, it’s not a program anymore. Now it’s something we used to do that used to happen quite easily before settler colonialism.” Goodwill is talking about her work with the Sto:lo at theSFU’s President’s Faculty Lectureon Wednesday, April 7 at 6 p.m. Participants have toregister for the lecture.

73,,"Jo Owens|Random House Canada $22.95 | 248pp “This is my home now. I am mute, immobile, tube-fed, and on drugs for my pain.” So says Francesca in the opening pages of Jo Owens’ debut novel A Funny Kind of Paradise. Frannie, following a severe stroke at the age of 70, is living out the end of her life in a five-bed ward of a residential care home. Still sharp as a tack, she recognizes that her situation is precisely what everyone hopes to avoid at the end of their own lives. She remembers thinking, as a young woman, that she would rather be dead than institutionalized, frail, wholly dependent. And yet, she notes, “I surprise myself: I just want to live.” Frannie is a wry observer of her surroundings, and through her eyes we learn the rhythms of the care home: Shift changes, medical interventions, the inevitable transitions as new patients arrive and others pass on. She imagines describing her days to Anna, her closest friend, whose death from cancer broke her heart. She reminisces about her tough, resilient life as a single mother, and her relationships with her children: Sweet, sensitive Christian, her dutiful son, and fiery Angelina, whose long absence is a wound that still aches. Her relationship with Anna was the foundation of her life, from the time that Frannie — pregnant, struggling, abandoned by her husband — walked into Anna’s welcoming diner. And yet Anna remains lightly sketched; I wanted to know more about her, the angelic woman who served as Angelina’s namesake. Owens, a care aide for more than 20 years, captures the skill and tenderness of caring for someone at the end of life in direct and unvarnished prose. The cast of care aides are the lively Greek chorus of the novel, as Frannie eavesdrops on their chatter about dating, contract negotiations and pushy family members. Each one — Molly, Lily, Michiko, even the frosty Blaire — is richly drawn and complex, and you come to admire them as much as Frannie does. There is, at times, too much detail about the minutiae of the work, but it serves to illuminate a vital profession that has been rarely documented in fiction. Everyone wants a swift, comfortable death at the end of a long, happy life. But many of us will find ourselves, like Frannie, losing our independence and becoming utterly reliant on others. Owens’ novel, rosy but not saccharine, lifts a curtain that we’re afraid to look behind. By the end of the novel, I had come to agree with Frannie: There is joy and meaning to be found in every stage of life, even the very end. To be loved, to love others, to have the chance to forgive your younger self for their mistakes. Every moment we have is a gift. CLICK HEREto report a typo. Is there more to this story?

74,,"In the days before Twitter, Bob Watson was a news photographer and he kept a police scanner bleating on his bedside table all night long. Bob revelled in his job, even its grisly bits, although I expect the scanner was put in its rightful place after he married Karen and they had their children, Alana and Sean. Bob loved his adopted home of Regina. He loved people, talked to everyone and remembered almost all of them. He had a great laugh and a great eye for an image. Most of all, he was kind. My friend and former Regina LeaderPost colleague died Sunday morning from COVID-19. He was 79. The city that the London, Ont. native grew to love is in lockdown, a pandemic hot spot in a province with higher infection rates per capita than most of the rest of Canada. It’s why I can’t separate the sadness over his death from my raw anger at the stupidity of anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers including the two Regina women fined $2,800 for organizing a Saturday protest that attracted 30 people, the owners and customers at the Corduroy and Gusto restaurants in Vancouver who ignored the ban on indoor dining, and the loudmouth Instagramer building an audience by provoking people as he drives up and down Robson Street with his megaphone. I’m angry at the mindless, childish banality of their protests as I think of the faces of grieving families and exhausted, anxious health-care workers and others on the front lines at groceries, pharmacies, schools and other essential services. Chanting “Freedom, freedom” in a restaurant that should have been closed would be biting satire on Saturday Night Live. Instead, it was stupidly real at Corduroy this past Saturday. As for megaphone guy, I fully understand why a cyclist used his bicycle to smash the side of the guy’s vehicle last week and was subsequently arrested. But I don’t deny that everyone has a right to free speech. Perhaps these people haven’t had friends or family affected by this pandemic. They’re lucky. But they’re delusional thinking that they’re not at risk and also incredibly selfish to think that they aren’t a risk to others. There have been more than a million Canadians who have had COVID or have tested positive. Health Canada’s most recent Fridayupdaterecorded 50,973 people in hospital, 8,991 in intensive care and 1,603 on ventilators. The virus is spreading relentlessly and the longer it spreads, the greater likelihood of it mutating into a more deadly variants like the one identified in Brazil. Three times more infectious that COVID-19, it’s infecting increasing numbers of younger people including Vancouver Canucks’ players. I know that public officials have a hell of a job making life-altering decisions day after day. Their assumption that the overwhelming majority would comply with their recommendations was right. Still, it increasingly seems that restrictions and their enforcement are too little and too late. Why didn’t B.C. shut down Whistler (population 40,000) before its case count hit 247 in the last week of March, nearly eight times what it had been in the first week of the month and more than the totals of at least one province and a couple of territories? When inspectors at Corduroy were shouted down and forced out on Saturday night, police should been called in to immediately to shut it down and suspend its licences. To bring this pandemic under control, it’s going to take a high percentage of inoculated people. Until then, there are only the cruder tools like masks, social distancing and stay-at-home orders to slow the mutating virus. It’s been a tough year of restrictions. So, what’s a few weeks or months to save lives and make it easier for those on the front lines like another friend, a paramedic? There was a day last week when ambulances had trouble getting across one of Vancouver’s bridges because of an anti-mask protest, she told me Monday before hanging up to rush to a call. “It’s beyond challenging,” she responded later in a hurried text. “I struggle to see my patients through a fogged up face shield, but end up screaming just to have a simple conversation … because nobody can hear us through the PPE (personal protective equipment).” There is the constant cleaning and disinfecting of the ambulance and the cot. Each shift is busier than before because there are more calls, more time needed to disinfect between them and because the B.C. Ambulance Service is short-staffed as paramedics test positive or burn out. She didn’t want her name used because she’s stressed enough without attracting the attention of COVIDiots. “On top of the PPE wearing all day, you get multiple headaches, rashes on your face and jaw pain and dehydration because you end up not drinking water. “And you’re not sleeping well and you’re always on because you never escape at work or after you go home.” Yet, bored, fearless “rebels” are prolonging and spreading the agony. I don’t know how my friend Bob contracted the virus. But I know he would have been careful. Bob cared too much about others to put them at risk. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter.com/bramham_daphne"
75,"Apr 02, 2021","Before the COVID-19 pandemic, about 80 seniors regularly ate a hearty, high-quality lunch together at theSilver Harbour Seniors Activity Centrein North Vancouver. Of more than 600 visits a day to the centre, about a quarter were about food, according toa report on how community-based seniors’ service agenciesresponded to the pandemic. When the centre closed because of COVID-19, it started to package its lunches and deliver them to seniors. It wasn’t long before Silver Harbour realized that not everyone could afford $10 per meal. So it organized partnerships to help deliver food to low-income seniors and added an option to pick-up meals. In March, for example, lunches such as cod loin with shrimp sauce, paella or garlic prawns could be delivered on some days; on others, people could pick-up lunches of cabbage rolls, bami goreng or butter chicken. “As a result of this work, the most vulnerable seniors in four subsidized housing buildings and living in the community received food and a brief social visit,” saysRising to the Challenge. “One representative said of the seniors served, ‘Seeing us once or twice a week made them feel good. Quite often, they wanted to stand there and chat. They’re still very appreciative.’ ” The case study is one of six cited in the92-page reportby the United Way of the Lower Mainland about how the province’s community-based seniors’ services (CBSS) responded to the pandemic. The report, released Tuesday, is based on more than 100 individual and group interviews with staff, volunteers and partner organizations, as well as eight focus groups and a survey. The report’s findings include: • The importance of a system-wide strategy to identify and connect with vulnerable seniors. • The existence of a digital divide and seniors without the means to connect to online services and groups. • The need to create and retain a more diversified age range of volunteers, many of whom are seniors. The report says that both people interviewed and focus group participants regularly reported that the pandemic has been experienced most acutely by the most marginalized and vulnerable seniors. “In other words, while the sector was successful at reaching out to seniors who were more isolated and had not previously accessed their services, there is still much work to be done is this area,” the report says. A positive finding is that community-based seniors’ organizations were able to respond quickly to new needs. Staff and volunteers knew their clientele and were able “to adjust their programs, overcome barriers and find ways to follow through on their commitments to seniors.” The report quotes one person who said: “I don’t think we have dropped the ball on a single situation. We’ve been able to jump up and provide whatever is necessary.” The report warns, however, that a return to conventional, competitive funding could reduce the sector’s effectiveness. To address that, the report calls for “sufficient, stable and secure funding.” It specifically mentions the need for core funding that isn’t tied to a specific program as well as for stable, multi-year funding that allows groups to plan for the future. “The value of the CBSS sector has been illuminated and confirmed through this study,”Rising to the Challengesays. “The data demonstrates the responsiveness and effectiveness of the sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
76,"Apr 01, 2021","An inspection of a long-term care home that was the site of British Columbia’s deadliest COVID-19 outbreak found staffing levels were low and cleaning was inadequate as the virus spread throughout the facility. The Vancouver Coastal Health inspection report obtained by The Canadian Press through a freedom of information request says these two issues were rectified while the outbreak was underway in Little Mountain Place. Bernadette Cheung, whose grandmother died of COVID-19 at the facility along with 40 other residents, wants more answers, including details on how the staffing shortage and poor infection control potentially worsened the outbreak. She filed a complaint that prompted the inspection on behalf of several family members who lost loved ones at the Vancouver care home. Cheung said she feels equally in the dark after receiving the report as she did before. “I feel like the investigation was very much done just to check off a box, as opposed to properly finding out where the failures were and really digging into finding solutions and ensuring that families have some sort of peace that this is taken seriously,” she said. Little Mountain Place referred questions to Vancouver Coastal Health. B.C.’s Health Ministry provided a statement on behalf of the health authority, which said there is an ongoing need to learn from the pandemic response, including in long-term care. Right now, the ministry said it’s focused on addressing issues in care homes, including easing visitation restrictions after most staff and residents have been vaccinated. “We’re learning every day, but there will certainly be a time for public reflection after this is all over.” In a statement in January, the health authority said it worked closely with the care home to bring the outbreak under control, including by screening and testing staff and residents, promptly isolating cases and employing infection prevention and control practices. The inspection report says a complaint was received on Jan. 6 and a site visit was conducted Jan. 11. The inspector found when the COVID-19 outbreak was declared on Nov. 22, staffing coverage was sufficient. However, as more employees contracted COVID-19, staffing levels “fell below facility baseline,” which temporarily affected daily operations and staff ability to respond to families’ questions. In response, Vancouver Coastal Health redeployed a significant number of staff to exceed the baseline requirements by 20 per cent, the report says, adding that most of the original staff returned to work and one-third of the redeployed health authority staff remained on site as of the inspection date. The report does not say how many staff members the facility was missing, how long the understaffing persisted nor how it affected the home’s ability to limit the spread of the virus. B.C. Centre for Disease Control figures show that 72 staff members contracted the virus over the course of the months-long outbreak. None died. Cheung questioned what the point was of the “vague summary” of understaffing. “I would imagine that these processes are in place to learn and understand where problems can occur and find maybe where the breakage point is in terms of understaffing,” she said. The report also says that when the outbreak was declared, Vancouver Coastal Health monitored the facility closely for the rate of transmission and any areas of concern. “Following this audit period, it was identified that the facility household team did not fully comprehend or implement the intended infection control/enhanced cleaning measures appropriately,” it says. On Dec. 13, three weeks after the start of the outbreak, Vancouver Coastal Health deployed a specialized infection control cleaning team to the facility. Education was provided to the staff and regular audits of enhanced cleaning measures continue to be conducted on a regular basis, the report says. Cheung said she’s frustrated that the focus appears to be on the cleaning team not knowing what to do, as opposed to management’s responsibility to train them. She also took issue with the inspector’s finding about the care home’s communication. The inspector said families were sent letters regularly with updates on the status of the outbreak and weekly Zoom calls were held to answer their questions. However, Cheung said two weeks passed before the first Zoom call, when families were shocked to hear there were already dozens of positive cases. During the calls, Cheung felt managers were evading questions. “We felt like we were being kept in the dark,” she said. In its previous statement, Vancouver Coastal Health said it takes all concerns raised by residents and families seriously, and any allegations of insufficient care are fully investigated. It also said it shared written communications regularly, in addition to the Zoom calls, and doctors and staff followed up with families directly. Cheung is still calling for a broader investigation of what went wrong at the care home, where ultimately 99 out of 114 residents tested positive. Cheung also wants to see an oversight board for care homes that exists outside of health authorities. “I don’t feel like anyone has truly taken accountability for what has happened,” she said. “I get it. It’s a really challenging situation. But at the same time, as family members we would have appreciated forthcoming responses.” B.C.’s seniors advocate, Isobel Mackenzie, is working on a larger review of COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes, which she hopes to publish in July. She said of about 500 sites in B.C., 212 had outbreaks. Of the sites that had outbreaks, most were contained to staff or a couple of residents. Therefore, her office plans to look at 25 or so of the worst outbreaks, including Little Mountain Place, to understand what went wrong. The age and size of the buildings, whether residents had shared rooms or shared baths, staffing levels, sick-leave policies, infection control practices and the age and condition of residents could all be factors, Mackenzie said. Her office will also undertake a survey of care home staff in B.C. that will hopefully give insight into the training they received, she said. Mackenzie said she expects the provincial government will face pressure from the public to implement her upcoming recommendations. “One of the things that’s been very heartening has been that the public is very much getting behind the issue of improvements to long-term care,” she said. “They now see what can happen, what does happen, and they’ve said, ‘We need to do better. We need to make improvements.’ So, I think people will be listening and they will expect their governments to act.”"
77,,"Anne Hendrickson loves her café mocha. Her daughter, Diane Barnhill, brings one every time she visits her 97-year-old mother inLynn Valley Care Centrein North Vancouver. With the new visiting rules in place at long-term care facilities in B.C., Hendrickson will be getting her treat of caffeine and sugar twice a week. Barnhill’s regular visiting time is 11 a.m. on Fridays. She’s not sure what day she’ll add, but probably Sunday or Monday to space out visits. “With the new rules, we can touch a little more and have a brief hug,” she said. “I’m allowed to visit her in her room with a mask, no gown. It’s great. They are allowing that now because we’ve all been vaccinated.” On Thursday, relaxed rules for visiting long-term care and assisted living came into effect in B.C. Thenew rules remove the requirementfor a single designated social visitor and allow for additional family and friends to visit. Now up to two visitors plus a child can visit at a time. They can also visit in a resident’s rooms without staff present. Physical touching is also allowed between visitors and residents so long as “appropriate infection and control measures” are in place such as masks and hand hygiene. Residents are now able to eat meals together and do recreational activities on a facility unit or floor. Residents can go on outings and aren’t required to isolate on their return. The new rules remain in place until June 30. Barnhill said the rules around visiting have been loosened, not removed. It doesn’t mean people can show up whenever they want to visit. “If you want to bring other family members, you have to send an email to let them know,” she said. “If they feel it is too many or not appropriate, they will let you know and say wait a minute.” Barnhill thinks the new rules will work — so long as everyone is reasonable. “No only would it not be safe to have too many visitors, I think after so much time in lockdown, it could overwhelm the residents to have so many people coming in,” she said. “They’ve done very well through this. They are fragile. They need to be eased out of lockdown.” Charlotte Buie, 83, has lived for 20 years atHaro Park Centrewhere she cared for her husband Gordon at first and then stayed after he died. She lives in a bachelor suite in the independent living section of the centre which includes assisted living and long-term care. She said she’d love to have her granddaughter visit under the new rules. “She’ll probably be glad to come indoors and sit with me,” Buie said in front of the centre. “We won’t have to sit in restaurants all day.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
78,"Mar 30, 2021","A group that has been pressing for a better plan to get COVID vaccinations to hundreds of low-income, vulnerable seniors in Chinatown is disappointed to see its request for a shuttle bus program to the nearest permanent clinic rebuffed, even as one is being rolled out in North Vancouver. “I just have this growing sense of many seniors still being left behind,” said Michael Tan, co-chair of the Vancouver Chinatown Legacy Stewardship Group, which was appointed by the City of Vancouver in 2019. This week, Vancouver Coastal Health announced a partnership with TransLink to run a shuttle bus every 15 minutes between Capilano Mall and a vaccination clinic on Lloyd Avenue that is a 10-minute walk away. “We’ve been pitching a similar idea to (VCH) for three weeks,” said Tan. His group would like to see a shuttle running from Chinatown to the Creekside Community Centre in the former Olympic Village, which is a 20-minute walk away. It is the closest full-time vaccination clinic, but it “might as well be on the moon, given many of the seniors’ mobility issues,” Tan wrote in a letter to VCH administrators and board members. “(Another) reason we have been pushing for more local services for accessing the vaccine is because we are seeing this compounding of concern among seniors about anti-Asian racism,” said Christina Lee, a researcher at the non-profit Hua Foundation. “There is definitely an overwhelming feeling of, at least, unease — not for all seniors, but a lot of them.” In recent weeks, anxieties have grown following a shooting spree in Atlanta that killed six Asian women and the brutal, random punching of a 75-year-old Asian woman in San Francisco who made headlines because she fought back and left her attacker bloodied and hospitalized. One Vancouver womantweetedabout her grandmother being “chased down and attacked in Vancouver Chinatown last week in broad daylight.” This week, Vancouver Coastal Health set up a one-day, pop-up clinic at the Carnegie Community Centre with capacity for 300 vaccinations, specifically for seniors living on their own in Chinatown. Tan, an accountant at a local tech firm, is also vice-president of the Chau Luen Society, a non-profit society that runs an affordable housing residence for over 100 seniors on Keefer Street, a few blocks away from the Carnegie Community Centre at Main and Hastings. He spent the past weekend knocking on doors at their building to notify residents of the pop-up clinic. Some aren’t able to walk very well, Tan said, so even with the Carnegie being nearby, he borrowed a few wheelchairs from S.U.C.C.E.S.S., the social services agency. “We don’t have wheelchairs. We’re only landlords,” he said. The estimated 1,900 seniors living on their own in affordable housing in Chinatown and Strathcona cannot afford health-care support services such as paid home care that might prioritize their getting vaccinated or flag someone to solve these challenges, said Lee. Most don’t live in a building run by a larger non-profit society with younger, more pro-active directors such as Tan. Wanda Ho of the Vancouver Second Mile Society said the one-day, pop-up clinic was planned after VCH explored, but didn’t proceed with, community suggestions to run mobile, vaccination stations that would go into various low-income and SRO buildings. “It’s good news, but we need more than just one pop-up clinic,” she said. Ho is less enthused about a shuttle bus to Creekside. “We’d still have to help so many get through the (phone) booking system. There are few community workers (to help these seniors) and building managers can’t really make the calls. Group bookings combined with either pop-up clinics or a shuttle bus would be better.” Vancouver Coastal Health said in a statement it is in “discussion with community partners to help ensure there are appropriate transportation options for people in the community.” “While there are nearby vaccination clinics, we understand it can be challenging for this group of vulnerable seniors to access clinics outside their local neighbourhood without support. We’ve been clear that if anyone faces challenges making it to a clinic, we will help them.” jlee-young@postmedia.com"
79,"Mar 26, 2021","As B.C. prepares to relax visitation restrictions at long-term care facilities on April 1, new research shows that a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine produces a much weaker antibody response in long-term care residents than it does in younger, healthy adults. That could have serious consequences for elderly people who live in the general community and may have to wait up to four months for their second dose. “There are many people who are frail and elderly living in the community, and there is no reason to believe their immune systems are any different than people in long-term care,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Marc Romney, who is a professor at the University of B.C. and a medical leader in virology at St. Paul’s Hospital. The small-scale study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, analyzed blood samples collected in late 2020 and early 2021 from residents and staff at long-term care homes in the Metro Vancouver area. Samples from 18 long-term care residents and 12 health-care workers were taken before vaccination to provide a baseline to measure changes after participants received their first dose. The results suggest that not only did the long-term care residents produce lower levels of antibodies than staff members, those they did produce were less adept at blocking the SARS-CoV-2 virus from binding to its target cells. The results were not necessarily a surprise, said Romney, who conducted the research with Dr. Zabrina Brumme at the B.C. Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS and Dr. Mark Brockman at Simon Fraser University. It is normal to see a “gradual fading of the immune system as we age,” he said. “In an ideal world, we would be following the findings of the clinical trials (in administering second doses), but because of supply issues it is a different situation.” B.C.’s decision to extend the interval from 42 days to four months was followed by arecommendationfrom the National Advisory Committee on Immunization in early March. But Romney said a “one-size-fits-all approach” to the timing of second doses may not be the best strategy for protecting people at different risk from the virus. The study, which isavailable pre-print on medRxiv, recommends not delaying the second dose for the elderly. Post-first dose infections remain very rare, said Dr. Tim Evans, executive director of the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, which funded the study. “Real-world clinical evidence from Canada and the U.K. shows that older persons, in long-term care or in the community, are well-protected for many weeks by a single dose,” said Evans. “Nevertheless, these findings are a reminder that there may be limits to how long we can stretch the time between doses for seniors and other segments of the population.” Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry also pointed to real-world evidence when asked about second doses during her media briefing on Thursday, referencing an outbreak at the Cottonwood Care Centre in Kelowna where a number of recently immunized people, including a small number who had received two doses in a short period of time, “had very mild illness.” She said the UBC study had only looked at a small number of people. “Looking at antibodies in 18 people doesn’t change our management when we have other studies that have shown us that there is still a very high level of protection overall,” she said. “And we do need to focus our attention on getting as many people that higher level of protection from a single dose right now.” The study comes as B.C. announced thatvisiting restrictions at long-term care facilities will be relaxedstarting April 1. Henry said all residents can have frequent and routine opportunities for social visitation, with visits over one hour permitted and physical touching allowed subject to appropriate infection-prevention measures such as mask-wearing. Long-term care residents will also be able to travel outside their facility and not have to quarantine upon their return. “We can support safe social connections again,” she said. Outbreaks have decreased in long-term care facilities following the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, from a peak in the high 40s to two on Thursday. B.C. has prioritized long-term care residents for the distribution of second doses. As of Thursday, 610,671 vaccines have been administered in B.C., of which 87,212 were second doses. “If we start to see a decrease in real-world protection, in vaccine effectiveness in elderly people, then we will speed up second doses for that group of people,” said Henry. “If we see a decrease in protection over time, we’ll be looking at changing that.” Henry said most people will get a second dose in four months, depending on supply. “I also think we need to look at the data that we have from other vaccine programs and what we’re seeing around the world. It may turn out to be that a booster dose is most effective if it’s given even later — maybe five or six months for most people. That may give us longer-lasting protection that will take us through next year’s respiratory season now that we believe that coronavirus is going to be with us for a while.” In a statement on March 3, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control saiddeferring the second dose of the vaccine could save more lives. Citing “strong scientific evidence” from clinical trials and real-world experience to support deferral of the second dose, the statement said “providing a first dose now to as many people as possible will save more lives and avoid more cases and hospitalizations and support a return to essential functions in our communities.” But the statement also said “a two-dose vaccination series remains important to provide long-term protection.” — With a file from David Carrigg gluymes@postmedia.com twitter.com/glendaluymes"
80,"Mar 23, 2021","The year-long pandemic has left people with dementia and their caregivers more stressed, lonelier and more isolated, according to a new UBC study, raising concerns about the impact of public health measures such as social distancing and care home visitation limits on this segment of the population. The study, published in theJournal of Alzheimer’s Disease, analyzed survey responses of 417 British Columbians, including 22 people with dementia and 395 caregivers of people with dementia. Participants ranged in age from their 20s to 80s, with the majority in their 70s. “What we’ve heard is that they’re experiencing high levels of stress and much more loneliness than before the pandemic,” said Dr. Julie Robillard, senior author and assistant professor of neurology at the University of B.C. Participants said they tried to address these issues using stress-reduction techniques or activities to support their mental health, but “in a lot of cases, those were not sufficient,” added Robillard. The survey, conducted between June and August 2020, found that 81 per cent of people with dementia reported sometimes or often feeling left out and isolated, while 76 per cent reported they lacked companionship. About 83 per cent reported feeling more isolated compared to before the pandemic. Public health orders to keep COVID-19 at bay, such as social distancing, limiting public gatherings, and restricting visits to long-term care homes, meant families and caregivers were limited from visiting or were unable to be physically close to people with dementia. Those responses were implemented rapidly because of the pandemic, said Robillard. “But now we’ve had more time to experience the pandemic … it’s important to involve people with dementia and care partners in that discussion on how we go about managing events like this as a society to make sure their needs and concerns are addressed.” Visitation limits were a major cause for concern for people with dementia and their caregivers, she said, not simply because people want to spend time with each other, but because representation and advocacy are crucial for people living with dementia. “It’s important that we are in touch with what is going on with their lives and can provide support when needed,” said Robillard. “Not being able to advocate for loved ones was very distressing to our participants.” Other concerns included worry the person they cared for would get infected from COVID-19 and access to therapy or a vaccine in the future, both from a practical standpoint, such as how to leave the house and get to the vaccination site, which can be a challenge for people living with dementia, as well as concerns over stigma or discrimination against them. One silver lining the study found was that 95 per cent of people with dementia and 86 per cent of caregivers reported they had been able to connect with friends and family during the pandemic, whether through a cellphone, laptops and tablets, or home phones, even though the majority reported the virtual meet-ups were not the same as a face-to-face interaction. “That was a great finding,” said Robillard. “We often assume older adults don’t engage with technology but they very much do.” However, 45 per cent of respondents reported experiencing technical issues, ranging from problems logging in (36 per cent), sound issues (23 per cent), video issues (23 per cent), and not being familiar with how the technology worked (23 per cent). That’s an opportunity for organizations like the Alzheimer Society of B.C. to offer technical support and programs using easy-to-use dementia-friendly technology or platforms, Robillard said. The society, which partnered with UBC researchers for this study, is already implementing the findings in its delivery of services, including offering user-friendly online programs, increasing the frequency of communication to people affected by dementia, and developing online resources on navigating long-term care visitation, providing at-home activities and managing caregiver stress. chchan@postmedia.com twitter.com/cherylchan"
81,"Mar 20, 2021","MONTREAL — Recent news that a Quebec hospital repeatedly posted notices seeking a “white woman” caregiver has sparked a debate about how to care for mentally ill seniors who refuse to be treated by people of another race. The heads of two placement agencies in Quebec say those kinds of requests usually come from racist patients who have dementia or Alzheimer’s. They say Black and other racialized workers are sent to care for other patients for safety reasons. But experts in the health field say trying to protect workers of colour by replacing them with white people is patronizing and paternalistic. “That is racism, that’s rationalization, said Bharati Sethi, a social work professor at King’s University College at Western University. Focusing on transferring racialized health-care workers instead of looking at bigger institutional issues downplays the problem, she said in an interview Friday. “Bluntly, we have to stop rationalizing, look at the problem at the root and do something about it,” Sethi, who worked as a personal-support worker before becoming a professor, said. Earlier this week, Montreal La Presse reported that a hospital in St-Eustache, Que., north of Montreal, sent 10 requests to placement agencies asking for a “white woman only” or a woman with “white skin.” The hospital had reportedly sought a white woman to care for a patient with dementia who was disruptive in the presence of racialized staff. In response, the regional health authority in Quebec’s Laurentians region said it has opened an investigation. Jill Eusanio, president of Comfort Keepers Quebec, said her placement agency receives requests for white workers a few times a year. She said, however, the issue is more complex than it may seem. “Usually, these requests are for senior citizens, clients, that are racist, and who have a mental disease that’s set in, like Alzheimer’s or dementia, and they’re mean to the worker,” she said in an interview Thursday. “What do I do?” Eusanio said. “Do I put a Black worker in this environment who will be verbally abused, who could be physically hit?” Eusanio, whose placement agency provides personal support workers, nurses and nurses aids for home care, long-term care facilities and hospitals, said she would never promise to send a white worker. But, she said, if one of her employees is being abused by a patient because of their ethnic background, she said she would switch them. Helene Gravel, head of Sherbrooke, Que.-based placement agency Agence Continuum, said requests for white workers are “very, very rare.” Gravel said those kinds of requests are intended to ensure employees aren’t placed in difficult situations when dealing with patients suffering from conditions like dementia and Alzheimer’s who have difficulty dealing with people who are different. In some cases, however, she has received requests from people recovering from surgery or other medical procedures who need temporary home care but don’t want a Black person helping them. In those cases, she said, she refuses to serve the client. She said she doesn’t tolerate racism. Sethi recently conducted a study on racism against personal-support workers at an Ontario nursing home. She found that Black workers frequently experienced racism from patients and their families, and in some cases, from colleagues. If personal-support workers are subject to racist abuse and believe they will be replaced by white people, then that might encourage them to stay silent out of fear of losing work, Sethi said. Dr. Sophie Zhang, who oversees 15 long-term care centres in Montreal, said she has had patients who are openly racist against workers, adding that it can be challenging to manage those patients when they’re suffering illnesses such as dementia. Regarding requests for white-only workers, Zhang said there are two issues involved: one is about accommodations in the workplace, while the other is about hiring discrimination. “For me, discriminating at the time of hiring is unacceptable,” she said in an interview Friday. “That, I don’t think we can make any excuses for.” Sometimes, however, when a decision needs to be made about who will be assigned to a patient, accommodations may have to be made, she said. “This is not because we want to ‘give in to racism,’ but it’s because sometimes the safety of the worker is at risk because there has been abuse, there has been verbal and physical abuse.” But she said it’s the last resort. When patients are able to be reasoned with, she said, the first step is dialogue. “My first reaction is to tell them that we don’t accept racism,” Zhang said. “That all our health-care workers are competent, are qualified, will take good care of them no matter what race they are, and that any sort of verbal or physical assault is not tolerated.” Sometimes, Zhang said, the patient ends up trusting the worker who takes care of them, adding that overall, she has had to manage few cases where people have demanded to be treated by non-racialized people. “It’s a very small number of cases where we have to intervene and make these accommodations.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 20, 2021. —— This story was produced with the financial assistance of the Facebook and Canadian Press News Fellowship."
82,"Mar 11, 2021","A vintage guitar was one of the few remaining connections Connie Vecchio had with the man her father Michael was before he began struggling with dementia. And now it’s missing fromTalarico Placein Castlegar, where Michael Vecchio is cared for. He had asked his daughter two years ago, in a lucid moment, to bring him his cherry Guild Starfire, which he’s owned for 48 years, but when she asked for it this week staff at the home couldn’t find it. “I miss him and the guitar kind of brings him back,” Vecchio said over the phone through tears. “I’m just trying to keep him with me.” Michael Vecchio, now 75, bought the guitar when he was 27 off of Nick Keraiff, who asBuddy Marrfronted a popular Kootenays doo-wop band called the Versatiles. Keraiff had been playing the guitar for awhile before selling it to his former student, and it likely was built in the 1960s. Online, people are asking anywhere from $635 for a Starfire I SC toas much as $5,510.24(plus $257.48 shipping from the U.K.) for a rare 1965 sunburst Guild Starfire V in its original hard case. Along with the guitar, Connie Vecchio delivered two amps and a guitar stand two years ago. The last time she saw them all was in February 2020, because COVID-19 protocols have meant visits are in a designated area and not in an individual’s room. On Tuesday she received an email saying the guitar stand and amps had been found in a basement storage area, but there was no sign of the guitar itself. Postmedia left a voicemail with the care home’s manager of clinical operations, Stacey Thin, but did not hear back by deadline. In an email to Connie Vecchio, Thin said staff have done everything they can think of to try to locate the guitar, including searching every room and the basement. Vecchio filed a report with the police and is offering a $1,000 reward. Her dad, Connie Vecchio said, was known around town as “the guitar guy,” and he wrote hundreds, if not thousands, of songs. You can watch his music videos on the YouTube channel CastlegarCrossRoads, songs with titles such asMississippi Blues,10,000 Songs About LoveandKaraoke King.

83,"Mar 10, 2021","After two days of backlogged call lines for seniors trying to book vaccines, B.C.’s health minister said the province caught up enough to allow anyone 85 or older to begin calling to book their immunization Thursday at noon. Health Minister Adrian Dix said Wednesday evening that anyone born in 1936 or earlier can book four days ahead of schedule thanks to increased call staff at the five health authorities. “This will allow people to get their appointments sooner and reflects the fact that for the most part, substantially, seniors over 90 have already booked their appointments,” Dix said. He estimated there’s about 75,000 eligible people between 85 and 89 who have not yet been immunized. A total of 39,163people across B.C. booked appointments Wednesday out of approximately 53,000 eligibleB.C. residents 90 and older and Indigenous elders 65 and older.In Vancouver Coastal Health, a total of7,699 people made bookings since Monday. In Fraser Health, 16,487 people have booked appointments over the three days. Island Health and Interior Health each booked around 6,000 people and Northern Health booked 2,860 people so far this week. Dr. Penny Ballem, head of the province’s immunization rollout and chair of Vancouver Coastal Health, said in a statement Wednesday that health authorities “are well on track to get everyone who is eligible booked this week and we can assure British Columbians that no one is going to miss out.” Iris Hicks, a 94-year-old Richmond woman was ready to give up after two fruitless days trying to book a vaccine appointment. She told her daughter she was “past her sell-by date anyways,” which had Lesley Hicks worried that her mother was having second thoughts about being vaccinated. “She really acted like it didn’t matter to her,” Lesley Hicks said. However, a bump in Telus call centre staffing on Wednesday seemed to make a difference, as Lesley Hicks booked an appointment for her mother after only 10 minutes on hold. When she told her mother she had booked an appointment, the nonagenarian was overjoyed. “I realized she really did want the vaccine,” her daughter said. Iris Hicks called her friends to let them know she now had an immunization date and rewarded her daughter’s persistence with a pedicure. “For the past two days, I’ve been so pissed off and so depressed, and today I feel like a different person,” Iris Hicks told Postmedia News by email Wednesday. Iris Hicks will get her vaccine on March 29 in Steveston, which her daughter said will allow for a celebratory meal of fish and chips after the appointment. Dix and Premier John Horganblamed Telus for the technical glitches and insufficient staffat vaccine booking call centres Monday and Tuesday, which meant thousands of people were met with busy signals or dropped calls. The Ministry of Health has so far refused to release the government contract with Telus or provide details on how much taxpayer dollars were paid to the company. During question period Wednesday, the B.C. Liberals pressed the government to release the contract and provide details on who “signed off on the botched plan.” Liberal MLA Mike de Jong repeatedly asked: “What is the premier hiding? Will he release the contract, and if not, why not?” Dix and Horgan dodged those questions, pointing to an uptick in appointments booked Wednesday as proof the phone system is back to full steam. Dix encouraged people to call and book their appointments. “What Telus did and Vancouver Coastal Health did was respond to a very bad day and you can see the difference,” Dix said. “We are sorry that people were delayed on Monday, but progress has been made.” Telus said on Wednesday it tripled its initial staffing commitment to prevent further delays. kderosa@postmedia.com twitter.com/katiederosayyj"
84,"Mar 09, 2021","Kuljit Dheensaw, a cancer survivor with chronic asthma, has been holed up in her Vancouver home for most of this pandemic-filled year, only leaving for doctor’s appointments or to grocery shop with her son-in-law. So, when she got a phone call last Thursday saying she would get her first COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday, she felt an instant wave of relief. “I was very excited. I was very, very fortunate that I got to get it so soon. It gives me a little bit more freedom. Even though I can’t take off my mask or anything, I can’t hug anybody yet,” she said, adding she hopes 2021 will bring happier times. “It should be a better year, just to get out and see people without being scared.” Now that long-term care home residents and staff are vaccinated, Dheensaw is part of a second vaccine rollout wave that Vancouver Coastal Health began March 1: delivering first doses of vaccine to those living and working in independent living centres and seniors’ supportive housing, as well as to homecare support clients and staff.Health authorities directly contact the people in this priority group to book appointments. That, of course, is different from the process underway right now for another phase of the vaccine rollout: residents over age 90 and Indigenous elders older than 65 who live in their own residences without home support, who couldstart phoning Mondayto schedule vaccination appointments at public clinics that begin next week. Since having the toes on one foot amputated due to cancer, Dheensaw, 80, has received home care support in her Vancouver residence, where she lives alone. On Saturday, she was vaccinated at the VCH COVID-19 clinic set up at Vancouver Community College, and gave the nurse an elbow touch to thank her — because she never wants to repeat what she went through in 2020. “It was frustrating. I’m disabled. I have a walker. I couldn’t go out anywhere. So it was just me, myself and my TV,” Dheensaw said. “I’m a people person. I go out here and there to the malls. And now I can go out again, although I know I can’t mingle too much.” Since March 1, VCH nurse Carole Fitzgerald has delivered between 10 and 14 vaccinations a day to seniors in their residences, a group of people deemed “homebound” because they can still live independently with support but are unable to travel to vaccination clinics. Fitzgerald, a nurse for 35 years, said the seniors and their families have been elated. “It’s been very, very challenging for these people to not see so much of their families and have very limited visitors, volunteers, etc. And then they are typically homebound. So it’s not like you or I, who could go out at least for a walk,” she said. “They’ve been very, very happy and excited (to be vaccinated). And I barely get in the door, and they’ve raised up their sleeve.” Grateful patients want to give her gifts or make her tea, and that appreciation has been nice for front-line workers: “I know in my own practice, lots of times we have visits where we have to talk about difficult things. We might have to do unpleasant interventions. However, this is just all positive.” Ann Florence Orange, who turns 100 this Monday, received many surprises over the last few days: birthday cards from Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, along with her first vaccination for COVID-19 on Sunday. “I was very pleased,” said Orange, adding that she was impressed that the vaccination didn’t hurt at all. Orange, who lived alone in her Richmond townhouse until age 98 when she moved in with her son David, now receives homecare support once a week. She is a stoic woman who tried not to worry about living through a pandemic, but does look forward to life becoming more normal again this year. The vaccination, though, brought relief to David Orange who did all the shopping for their household. “The last thing I wanted to do was be responsible for coming in and bringing her the virus, with all the possible effects that could have at her age. So by virtue of the fact that she’s now had the vaccination, it lifts that certain degree of worry off my shoulders. I feel more comfortable and she’s safer.” His mother got the vaccine at a VCH clinic near Vancouver airport, a process that he said seemed well-organized and safe. “There were people waiting at the gate. It was clearly signposted. There was literally a person standing with a reflective vest, telling us where to go,” David Orange said. “When we got to parking, the young man came up and said, ‘Please stay in your car, sir. You’re just a little bit early, but I’ll let you know as soon as we are ready for you to come in,’ which he did. People there just absolutely could not have been better set up or nicer.” For patients who aren’t as spry as his spunky centenarian mother, vaccinations are being delivered in homes by nurses like Fitzgerald. “It’s such a needed service to be able to help people where they’re at because the whole system doesn’t work the best for frail elders, in terms of getting out to attain services,” she said. If the seniors receiving home care or living independently in a supported centre have a spouse or roommate who is older than 70, than that person will also get a vaccination during this rollout, Fitzgerald said. lculbert@postmedia.com"
85,,"A series of attacks by coyotes on humans in Stanley Park suggest that an alpha pair of animals are responsible, an urban wildlife specialist says. Dr. Stanley Gehrtsaid it is likely that the dominant breeding male and female coyotes in the park are behind the attacks. In the wild, when coyotes are hunting prey larger than themselves, attacks are initiated 100 per cent of the time by the alpha pair. What is happening in Stanley Park, he suggested, is an extension of that behaviour. “The vast majority of these kinds of unprovoked attacks often come from the alpha pair,” he said. “I think everyone would agree when they’re exhibiting this kind of behaviour, the safest thing is to remove them.” But coyotes, he said, are wily, intelligent, and extremely difficult to trap. “People often don’t realize that it is often really difficult to capture and remove coyotes from a large park.” In late February, Postmedia reported that the number ofaggressive coyote attacks on humans has increased to 15 in Stanley Parksince December. Although people have sighted coyotes throughout Metro Vancouver, no other attacks by coyotes on humans have been reported in the region. In early January, conservation officials euthanized two coyotes in Stanley Park believed to be responsible for the attacks. A few days later,Azi Ramezani was attacked and bitten from behindby a coyote while she was running near the Hollow Tree. Another incident occurred on March 6 when actor Alan Tudyk, one of the stars of the sci-fi series Resident Alien,reported a coyote snapping at his wife in Stanley Park,nabbing their dog Raisin, and refusing “for 10 minutes” to let it go. He believes that only keeping Raisin on a leash saved its life. Gehrt, a professor of wildlife ecology at Ohio State University, said that with the aggressive attacks on humans in Stanley Park continuing, the male or female of the alpha pair may still be roaming free in the park. Taking a swab to test for DNA from the jogger attacked by the Hollow Tree, he said, is what should be done so conservation officers can determine the identity of the coyote. He said it is “very rare” for this kind of ongoing aggressive behaviour to continue in an urban setting. Gehrt is the principal investigator of theCook County Coyote Project, which has been ongoing since 2000. Of446 radio-collared coyotes studiedin the county, which includes Chicago, 14 have been reported as nuisances. Of the estimated thousands of coyotes in the metro region, the first coyote bite of a human was reported last year. The research of coyotes with radio collars in Chicago shows what happens when people feed them. “It changes their behaviour,” Gehrt said. “Sometimes you can get them to revert back — if you can get people to stop feeding them. They will naturally revert to being the shy animal that tries to avoid people, that’s the way it’s supposed to work.” If the aggressive attacks are the result of people feeding coyotes, putting up signs and launching a public education campaign to stop feeding wildlife needs to be backed up with enforcement, he said. “Unfortunately, another feature of urban systems is people who will feed wildlife,” Gehrt said. “They’re going to feed wildlife no matter what you tell them. You can give them all the literature you want. You can put up signs and they will still continue to feed wildlife. In some cases, you have to physically or financially make them stop.” He said there is an example in the Chicago area where a couple who live adjacent to a park won’t stop feeding coyotes. “We’ve had two radio-collared animals that went from being shy and nocturnal and avoiding people to being active during the day and walking into people’s yards because they’re eating the food this couple puts out,” he said. The couple has been fined and arrested. He said in the past month, they have returned to their old habits and started feeding coyotes again. Serious incidents such as the attacks in Stanley Park can’t be ignored, he said, but it is unfortunate that conflict like that brings coyotes to people’s attention. “There are people probably jogging past a coyote right now and nothing happens,” he said. “They don’t get to see all the non-incidents that happen all the time. These animals are remarkable.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com Study finds coyote attacks on humans linked to outdoor activities A study of coyote attacks on humans found 47 per cent of the incidents occurred while people were doing something recreationally outdoors, such as jogging, hiking and bicycling. Coyote Attacks on Humans in the United States and Canada, co-authored by Dr. Stanley Gehrt, studied 142 incidents involving 159 victims from 1960 to 2006 in 14 states and four provinces, including B.C. It found that in 47 per cent of cases, victims were involved in an outdoor activity such as jogging, hiking and bicycling. A total of 37 per cent of attacks were considered predatory, defined as aggressive and direct pursuit of a human ending with a bite, 24 per cent were unknown, and 22 per cent investigative, meaning a coyote was used to people and may have been testing the victim as possible prey, including biting someone who was sleeping or immobile. In 42 of 142 cases “coyotes were either intentionally or accidentally being fed by a resident near the attack site prior to the incident.” In one case, an example of biting the hand that feeds you, the “victim was hand-feeding the coyote that subsequently bit him.” “The large number of attacks occurring within daytime hours suggests that in some cases the offending coyotes were no longer avoiding humans and may have become habituated to human activity, likely due to intentional or accidental wildlife feeding.” In parks, playgrounds and campgrounds, the study says, “a ban on feeding coyotes and other wildlife is particularly important for preventing future attacks.”"
86,"Mar 03, 2021","A Vancouver resident who regularly walks in Stanley Park and was followed by a coyote thinks more needs to be done to deal with the aggressive animals in the park. Donna Leyland walks in the park with a friend two or three times a week. Until recently, the Coal Harbour resident used trails crossing the central areas of Stanley Park. But after an encounter on Feb, 7, she now walks on trails on the sidewalk by the road. Leyland and a friend were on the Bridle Path at about 3:30 p.m. on a sunny afternoon when they saw the coyote, about 15-metres away. It was on the side of the trail looking at them. Leyland took a photo. “I waved my arms, I yelled. It just looked at us and didn’t move,” Leyland said. “So we turned around — I’ve since found out that it wasn’t the smart thing to do — and started walking slowly away from the coyote. “It turned and followed us.” Afterwards, Leyland said she phoned the city, theStanley Park Ecology Societyand the provincial emergency phone line. “They basically said they were studying it, which means nothing is going to happen,” Leyland said. “I think he suggested that I could carry a stick. I’m not going to take on a coyote.” Leyland said she no longer feels safe in the park. She thinks something needs to be done to deal with aggressive coyotes. Her solution is to remove them. “It’s all about the people who enjoy the park changing our behaviour to accommodate the coyotes,” she said about suggestions by officials. “To me, that isn’t a solution.” Last week,a provincial conservation officer told Postmedia Newsthat there had been 15 attacks by coyotes on park-users, mostly runners, in Stanley Park since Dec. 1. In 13 cases, the bites were described as serious. In two cases, people on bikes were attacked. The conservation officer classified the coyote’s behaviour as predatory because it was similar to what the animal would do to attack prey such as deer. If people are using the park, the conservation officer said, they should be aware that they’re likely to come in contact with a coyote that could approach them. It was suggested that the coyotes have become habituated to humans because someone has regularly been feeding them. Officials don’t know the exact number of coyotes in Stanley Park but estimate there are between six and 12. Two have already been euthanized for aggressive behaviour. Dannie Piezasis the urban wildlife program coordinator at the Stanley Park Ecology Society that operatesCo-Existing with Coyotes. One of the program’s initiatives is aCoyotes Sightings Map,which lists reported coyote sightings and attacks. Piezas said as far as she can tell, there have been no other reports of attacks by coyotes on humans in the Metro Vancouver region covered by the map. “This situation in Stanley Park has been quite unique,” she said. “Nothing like what is going on in Stanley Park is being seen anywhere in the Lower Mainland — as far as I can tell.” If someone is regularly feeding coyotes in the park, it’s not fair to the animal because it trains them to lose their fear of humans, Piezas said. It’s also illegal and subject to a fine of up to $50,000. “If an individual coyote has lost its fear of people and is expecting food reward, it could all combine into that situation where they will chase a jogger and nip at a person,” she said. Some descriptions, she said, appear to indicate that the coyote may be trying to initiate play. “Coyotes can be similar to dogs in that way,” Piezas said. “They use their mouths for play. They’ll do that with each other and pull on each other’s scruff. It’s also possible that they’re trying to do that with people. They just aren’t socialized to know what’s harmful to us.” Reports of feeding coyotes and other wild animals in Stanley Park can be made at any time by phoning1-877-952-7277. Coyotes have been in Stanley Park since the 1980s One of the first stories of coyote sightings in Stanley Park was in October 1988 in The Vancouver Sun. At the time, acting park board manager Mike Mackintosh said he believed coyotes made their way to the park from the forested area at what was then called the University Endowment Lands (now Pacific Spirit Regional Park) at the University of B.C. Mackintosh said coyotes are wily. “They are very, very clever animals and they are very wary of traps,” he told The Sun. Coyotes have shown their adaptability by spreading from the central-plains area of the continent to urban areas all over North America. In 2001, in response to a study by UBC, the program,Co-Existing with Coyotes,was established by the Stanley Park Ecology Society. The program was created in recognition that the best approach focused on educating humans about how to live with coyotes. Culling was perceived to be unethical; removal as expensive and not practical because of the coyote’s resilience in re-establishing itself. Dannie Piezas,the society’s Urban Wildlife Program coordinator, said the goal of the program is to keep people, pets and coyotes safe. When coyotes become habituated to people, the healthy boundary between humans and wild animals has been lost. “In those rare and specific cases, coexistence has become impossible,” she said. “In some cases, the conservation officer has to come in and provide a lethal option — euthanize.” The scientific name for coyotes is canis latrans. They have fluffy tails that point straight down and ears that are bigger than a dog’s and point straight up. Their eyes are yellowy-gold. kevingrififn@postmedia.com"
87,"Feb 28, 2021","Advocates are calling for a more coordinated plan for vaccinating low income seniors living in Chinatown’s hundreds of affordable housing and SRO units. “We just thought we would raise the point to make sure it’s on people’s radar,” said Michael Tan, co-chair of the Vancouver Chinatown Legacy Stewardship Group, which was appointed by the City of Vancouver. So far, he sees very little sign of any groundwork in place for how Vancouver Coast Health (VCH) plans to inform and ensure seniors in Chinatown have access to the COVID-19 vaccine. Tan is also vice-president of the Chau Luen Society, a non-profit that was established in 1943 and runs a low-income housing residence for over 100 seniors on Keefer Street. He said Chau Luen, like other societies that manage buildings with mostly Chinese senior residents, isn’t just a landlord. It also provides “linguistically accessible and culturally appropriate programming and support (so) residents are able to live fully.” He estimated there are about 1,900 seniors living by themselves in Chinatown and Strathcona, mostly in SROs and affordable housing units. In a letter from the stewardship group to VCH, Tan described concerns stemming from early vaccination clinics in recent weeks for more vulnerable populations at the Carnegie Community Centre. “They were lacking in Chinese-translated materials and also required seniors to stand out in the rain for hours while awaiting a vaccination,” said Tan. He is proposing that mobile teams could give the vaccine in the common areas available in many Chinatown society buildings. “We do see some of the seniors using an iPad or what not,” said Tan. “They know where to go for (watching TV or a call), but to explore and find out how to register or get a vaccine on an English website. That’s a big ask.” Tan said VCH could coordinate with the societies and groups that operate these buildings, using lists the City of Vancouver already has in hand. That information is probably a few years old and will have to be updated to be really useful, said Nick Yung, who works in outreach to Chinese seniors for the advocacy group, DTESSRO Collaborative. Yung said existing lists usually name the directors. What’s further needed are the building managers and caretakers or even just “who the more respected or influential tenants are.” They have the trust and relationships needed for making sure key information is not only delivered, but accepted and understood by Chinese seniors in these buildings. Buildings with affordable housing units run by larger societies with younger directors, such as Tan’s Chau Luen, are better positioned to work effectively with government health authorities to administer vaccines and handle outbreak situations, said Yung. However, there are some societies that run smaller buildings of SRO units that are more disconnected. Mere translation of information is only part of the solution, said Yung. He has studied notices pinned on message boards in the hallways of some of these buildings to design posters about kitchen and bathroom hygiene using colours, fonts and images that aesthetically fit in, so they won’t be ignored. “We need resources to have more foot soldiers on the ground to go out and understand who and what can help,” said Yung, who said he will meet with VCH next week. In a reply to Tan’s letter, VCH interim president and CEO Vivian Eliopoulos said, “we are taking into careful consideration the challenges faced by many seniors, including technology and language.” She said information will be available online and in print in several different languages and it will make “every effort to immunize seniors in the communities where they live.” jlee-young@postmedia.com"
88,"Feb 25, 2021","Even in a household where one person has received a COVID-19 jab, everyone who hasn’t been vaccinated should still take public health precautions, says a professor of molecular biology and biochemistry. Fiona Brinkmanfrom Simon Fraser University said even when someone is vaccinated, it can take three weeks until a person’s immune system develops enough antibodies to achieve protection. “As a general rule, we don’t want to change our practices in terms of wearing masks and physical distancing through the vaccination campaign,” she said. “Once we get to enough people vaccinated, then we can open things up.” Brinkman is the co-leader on data analytics for theCanadian COVID Genomics Networkwhich is sequencing COVID-19 genomes to track its viral origin, spread, and evolution. She said the provincialCOVID-19 immunization planuses factors such as risk and age to determine vaccine eligibility for everyone through to September. It’s up to public health officials to decide if any changes to eligibility criteria are warranted, Brinkman said. Brinkman was responding to the case of April Troje, 67, who is caring for her mother-in-law Inge Troje, 90. April is the primary caregiver for Inge in their home in Surrey. She’s worried that if she became sick and was hospitalized with COVID-19, there wouldn’t be anyone to take care of Inge. “When Mum gets the vaccine would I be eligible at the same time?” she asked. “I’m fine waiting in line for my turn. I’m not trying to be a line jumper by any stretch.” April said she wears her mask when outside of the home, maintains physical distancing and has limited her personal bubble to a grandson, daughter, and next door neighbour. “She’ll be protected because she’s in the next phase,” April said about Inge. “I’m 67 and a little ways down the line.” Under theB.C. government’s phased vaccine program, people aged 80 and over who are not residents of care homes will be vaccinated in Phase 2 this month and in March. Then vaccination moves down in five-year increments starting at age 79 to 75. Those aged 67 are in Phase 3 and could receive the first dose in May or June and the second in June or July. “Monthly breakdowns for the first dose and second dose are estimates and may change based on vaccine availability,” theB.C. COVID-19 immunization plansays. kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
89,"Feb 24, 2021","VICTORIA — With B.C. recording one of the highest COVID-19 case counts of the year, it fell to Dr. Bonnie Henry and Adrian Dix to put the number into perspective. “We are holding steady in this past month,” the provincial health officer said Tuesday in announcing 559 new cases. “This uptick that we’ve seen in the last few days is one that we are managing as aggressively as we can to understand better where we are.” The health minister acknowledged “a challenge right now because we see transmission daily between 500 and 600 cases, significantly in Metro Vancouver. And that’s why we have to not stop right now. … Don’t stop what we have proven works.” A month ago, when Henry reported 471 cases, she issued a “special request to everyone” listening. “We have plateaued at about 500 new cases of COVID-19 a day,” she said. “This is too many. This leaves us at a precipice, at a brink where we can see rapid takeoff, particularly if these new variants start to transmit in our community.” Then her plea: “Less (cases) is where we need to go and we need your help to get there. Over the next two weeks, I believe we can bend the curve, not just plateau, but bend it back down.  These next two weeks I am asking you to do more.” That was Jan. 25. Four weeks and two, 14-day incubation periods later, the case count was in the same range — 559 cases Tuesday, 456 Wednesday — as when she called for help to bend the curve downward. Did those who were still listening figure they can’t do any more? Did some other factor keep the count at the 500-case plateau? Dix and Henry didn’t say Tuesday. Instead they chose to accentuate the positive news about how vaccines have been used to contain the terrible toll of COVID-19 in long-term care homes. “This is a success that we need to appreciate and celebrate,” as Dr. Henry put it. She’s surely right about that. But the variants of concern are still out there along with what she earlier characterized as “too many” cases. Vaccines are the key to winning the race against the variants. But the health officer and the health minister brushed aside suggestions that British Columbians have been kept in the dark about the coming vaccine rollout. “We did tell you, in as much detail as we knew, the basis of the program,” Henry insisted. “It has not changed.” “In January, we laid the vaccination plan out in detail,” said Dix. “We briefed the media, we briefed the public, the plan was available and public health officials and staff have executed that plan extremely well.” They only confirmed the April 6 startup for mass vaccination clinics after the date was leaked to The Vancouver Sun. And, when it comes to vaccinating people over the age of 80, the government’s own briefing documents indicate that the rollout is two weeks behind schedule. The delay is readily attributable to the corresponding delays in delivery of vaccines from the federal government. Henry emphasized that the time lost through delayed vaccine deliveries was not wasted in terms of planning opportunities. “All of us across the country were thrown for a bit of a loop when our vaccine dried up for a few weeks,” she said. “But we’ve been using that time to put our systems in place, to get the lists of people and to make sure that we know exactly how and who we can reach out to. It’s been a challenge for all of us and this is on a grand scale.” With the rollout of the next phase of the vaccine strategy set for Monday, British Columbians will be able to judge for themselves whether the scale is sufficiently grand. But Henry has no doubt where all this is headed. “By the time we get to the summer we’re going to be in a different place,“ she predicted. “It’s going to take all of us working together and being patient and supporting our neighbours and supporting our elders and seniors in our lives to get this going … and I am going to be there as the biggest cheerleader because this is what is going to get us out of the pandemic.” One thing the Health Ministry did confirm Wednesday was that people who wish to be vaccinated will NOT have to go through the elaborate procedure of applying for a B.C. Services Mobile Card that I described Wednesday. “We are working to make the vaccination process for all ages as simple, safe and efficient as possible,” said the statement from the ministry. “The process we are working on will take into account people’s different needs and different ways of accessing information and will ensure nobody eligible to receive the vaccine is left behind,” the statement continued. Having provided those welcome assurances, the ministry did not actually say how people can go about registering. “We look forward to sharing more details about this on Monday,” concluded the statement, setting the stage for the next exercise in positive reinforcement on the pandemic. vpalmer@postmedia.com"
90,"Feb 21, 2021","Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart recently called the opioid overdose epidemic “one of the greatest policy disasters in the history of the province.” Listening to him, it’s hard for some people not to conclude that the violence and dysfunction on the city’s Downtown Eastside would largely disappear if only we had: decriminalization of all drugs for personal possession, a safe supply of drugs to every addict, and “wraparound services” for those with the most severe addictions and mental health problems. Federal Justice Minister David Lametti isn’t one of them. Decriminalization was absent from his package of criminal law reforms introduced late last week. Instead, the bill proposes giving police and prosecutors the discretion to consider alternatives to prosecution, including treatment. This is not to suggest that the mayor’s belief in those solutions isn’t heartfelt. When I spoke to Stewart recently, he told me that a family member had died of an overdose the previous week. The funeral was the following day. “Anything we can do to save lives,” he said. “We may not wake up with rainbows and flowers blooming, but if we can significantly reduce deaths, we need to do it.” In 2020, 408 Vancouverites were among the 1,716 British Columbians and more than 5,233 Canadians who died from illicit drugs that were overwhelmingly laced with high doses of fentanyl. “The question is how do we help them manage to stay alive and lead the most productive lives possible.” For Stewart, harm reduction is about safe supply, supervised injection sites, free needles and is “a management tool, not a way to bring an end to addiction.” He firmly rejects what has been done in Portugal, which decriminalized drugs more than 20 years ago as part of a broader package of reforms that focused on treatment and recovery that would provide a pathway to services. There, people who are found with amounts deemed within the limits for personal use, have their drugs confiscated and are required to appear before a commission for the dissuasion of drug use. They go before a panel that includes doctors, social workers and lawyers, who provide recommendations for services. Treatment is not mandatory, at first. But it can be mandated for those who appear frequently before the commission. The most recentdatafrom 2019 shows that it’s working. In Vancouver last year, there were 58.9 illicit overdose deaths per 100,000 people. In Portugal, it was 0.45 deaths per 100,000. That is one of the lowest in Europe despite Portugal having the sixth-highest opioid use. One significant factor in the difference between European and North American opioid overdose numbers is that fentanyl remains relatively rare there. Beyond curbing deaths, the education part of Portugal’s plan has resulted in the use of all other drugs dropping to amongst the lowest levels in the European Union. Recently, Oregon and Norway have used Portugal’s example to guide their own policies that include both decriminalization and significant investments in treatment and recovery. But Stewart said the Portuguese model is “too restrictive.” “Portugal has a guaranteed income. They provide (recovering addicts) with jobs,” he said. “If the senior levels of government want to fully adopt that, it might change the options. “Until that changes, the best options are safe supply and decriminalization.” But for nearly a decade and throughout the public health emergency, Vancouver has had de facto decriminalization. So, it’s clearly not a magic bullet. As for safe supply, since COVID, Vancouver has become an open-air laboratory where physicians, nurse practitioners, registered and psychiatric nurses are able to prescribe addicts with pharmaceutical replacement drugs. Health Canada has granted an exemption and $15 million over four years for replacement drugs to be used without direct medical supervision and prescribed in multiples (with the suggestion that they be packaged in blister packs so that users will know which day to take which dose). The pharmaceutical replacements are for heroin and other opioids, benzodiazepines, stimulants, alcohol and tobacco. It is too soon to say whether it’s helping. Prior to Lametti’s bill being tabled in Ottawa, Stewart directly linked decriminalization to his 2022 re-election bid. Team Kennedy Stewart sent out emails urging people to go to its website to send a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet urging them to “support Mayor Kennedy Stewart’s unanimously supported council motion to decriminalize simple possession of drugs.” The goal is have 1,500 letters sent and, as a byproduct, Stewart’s team will have captured names, email addresses, postal codes and mobile phone numbers. The mayor and former political science professor is right that there has been an historic failure in public policy that has led us to this point of daily deaths from drugs. Yet, while Stewart is preoccupied with issues and policies over which Vancouver has little or no control, the Downtown Eastside is worse than it has ever been, and now that disorder, dysfunction and violence is spreading to other neighbourhoods. Streets, roads and public safety? Those are all things that the city not only has the power to deal with, but the responsibility. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
91,"Feb 19, 2021","Anna Hendrickson, 97, received her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine this week. “We’re so grateful and relieved,” her daughter, Diane Barnhill, said on Friday shortly after her weekly visit. Hendrickson lives at the Lynn Valley Care Centre, which recorded Canada’s first COVID-19 death almost one year ago. In the months since, B.C.’s care homes have been shaken by loss and struggled under restrictions that have prevented residents from connecting with loved ones. Butweekly datafrom the B.C. Centre for Disease Control suggests there may be reason for cautious optimism. With COVID-19 vaccines offered to all long-term care residents and staff in B.C., cases and deaths across the province appear to be dropping. From Feb. 1 to 16, there have been 13 new cases and no deaths in long-term care, compared to 379 new cases and 60 deaths connected to outbreaks declared from Jan. 1 to 31, and a peak of 1,839 new cases and 341 deaths connected to outbreaks declared from Nov. 1 to 30. While there are 14 activeoutbreaksin long-term care and assisted living facilities, six have been added to the list since the beginning of the month and they have so far remained small, at four cases or less. In comparison, during January, there were 21 new outbreaks, and in November, 62. B.C. seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie said B.C. is “seeing what we hoped we’d be seeing” after a majority of care home residents and staff were vaccinated. While some of the decrease is likely due to lower community transmission, as cases in the general public were also falling in early February, the reduction in care home cases has been even more dramatic, signalling vaccination programs are working. “The good news is that we’re clearly seeing evidence of the vaccine,” said Mackenzie. “But there is still a need for caution. We need to take all the precautions. Outbreaks are not at zero and the vaccine is not 100-per-cent effective.” The seniors advocate said she is concerned about how some care homes are interpreting the provincial health orders and guidance around essential visitors as it varies from facility to facility. “Things will have to go back to normal,” she said, emphasizing that a long-term care facility is a person’s home and they cannot be cut off from their loved ones indefinitely. Jenny Bailey, 81, lives in an assisted living facility near Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver. She has received one dose of the vaccine and should get another in a few weeks. She visits with her daughter on an outdoor patio to be careful. “I’m looking forward to a hug. I haven’t had a hug in 11 months,” she said. Residents and staff at Tabor Home in Abbotsford, where an outbreak before Christmas led to 26 deaths, had their second dose of the vaccine this week, said Dan Levitt, executive director ofTabor Village. “There’s a renewed sense of optimism and relief,” he said. “We’re still doing everything we should be doing in terms of PPE and health screenings, so life hasn’t gone back to normal, but psychologically, I think it’s calmer and there’s less anxiety.” The facility is still dealing with the aftermath of an outbreak that saw five people die in one day in November — the same number of people who died in the entire month of November in 2019. A virtual prayer meeting is planned next week for family and staff who are recovering from the losses. While COVID-19 variants present a large unknown for the future of the pandemic and B.C.’s care homes, there is “no question people are feeling better,” said Terry Lake, CEO ofB.C. Care Providers Association. He said he doesn’t expect health officials to consider “liberalizing” visitation policies until mid-March, possibly allowing residents to add another social visitor. In the meantime, care home operators are continuing to push for rapid testing to help with screening. In a joint statement Friday afternoon, Dr. Réka Gustafson, B.C.’s deputy provincial health officer, and Minister of Health Adrian Dix said “preliminary evidence” from the immunization of long-term care residents and staff “shows us COVID-19 vaccines are proving to be highly effective in reducing outbreaks and protecting those who are most at risk of severe illness and death.” With files by Nathan Griffiths gluymes@postmedia.com twitter.com/glendaluymes"
92,"Feb 18, 2021","Residents of seven B.C. seniors’ homes, including one with one of the deadliest COVID-19 outbreaks, have been or soon will be fully vaccinated, but a virologist studying how well the vaccine worked on those elderly residents said it will likely be months before restrictions are lifted, and long-term care homes may never return to pre-pandemic freedoms. “We hope some of the findings of our study can be used by public health officials as they move forward with their approach to visitors,” said the study lead, Dr. Marc Romney, who heads upmedical microbiology and virology at Providence Health Care. But he said it will be months before the study results can be used to inform public health policy for the long-term care homes, where the majority of B.C. deaths from COVID-19 have occurred. The study will test about 200 elderly residents and staff who live or work in six long-term care homes, including the Holy Family home, where 21 residents died last summer in the first of three outbreaks at that home, and an assisted-living home run by Providence Health. Their blood will be tested one, two, six and 12 months after getting the second dose. The study’s goal is to try to find out why the elderly are more likely to get severely ill, be hospitalized and die from COVID-19, said Romney. Researchers will try to determine how well the vaccine works and how long it lasts. But even with a high vaccination rate and a high efficacy rate, it won’t necessarily mean long-term care homes will be run as they were before COVID. “With influenza, we know that even with a highly vaccinated population, with a 90 per cent vaccination rate, we still saw outbreaks,” he said. “We’re probably not going to return to the way long-term care homes were before because of the risk and the disproportionately high number of residents affected by the virus,” said Romney. Jenny Bailey, 81 — “I’ll be 82 in March” — volunteered to be inoculated and to take part in the three followup blood tests and questionnaires when it was offered to her and others at the Honoria Conway at St. Vincent’s assisted-living care home. “Anything we can do to help people who are in charge to know more (about how the vaccine protects the elderly) is a good thing,” said Bailey, who taught art at a college and raised two children. “That’s the part that pleased me.” She has had one dose so far and is scheduled to receive the second in the next two weeks. Alfred Best, 95 — “I’ll be 96 in April” — lives atBrock Fahrnilong-term care home, where he was given his second dose on Tuesday. The Second World War veteran, father of two, grandfather of seven and great-grandfather of 11, said he registered for the voluntary study so he could help researchers learn more about the vaccine. Both residents are relieved to be vaccinated and to learn through the study’s initial blood test that they hadn’t had the coronavirus. Romney, who said he was grateful for the staff and residents who volunteered to participate, said the study eventually may be rolled out to other long-term care homes in B.C. Partners in the study includeUBC,SFUand theB.C. Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS. The $2-million study, which also looks at cellular and innate immunity, was funded by Canada’sCOVID-19 immunity task force. CLICK HEREto report a typo. Is there more to this story?

93,"Feb 17, 2021","If the Chinatown Foundation does break ground this spring for its integrated health facility and 230 social housing units in the Downtown Eastside, it will bring an end to a battle that began in 2008. That was when Concord Pacific demolished the Fields department store at 58 West Hastings with plans to build luxury condos on the site that takes up most of a city block. After the global recession hit, the company paused its plans and put up a chain-link fence. It has been the launching pad for occupations and marches to City Hall ever since. Twice, it has been taken over by tent camps, including during the 2010 Olympics when it was cleared by court order. As a housing proposal lurched through the approval process, a non-profit group established a community garden. More recently, it has been the site of the Downtown Eastside street market, an unauthorized overdose prevention site, and emergency medical unit. Assuming all goes well — that being a relative term at this point — it will be 2024 before the $115-million building operated under a B.C. Housing contract by the non-profit S.U.C.C.E.S.S. will welcome the first residents and Vancouver Coastal Health’s 50,000-square-foot facility is opened. The foundation has raised more than $30 million, which has been matched by the province. The city has committed $38-million worth of land, and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. is said to be committed to funding the remainder, but it has yet to officially announce its contribution. The site has been an epicentre of protests as homeless numbers rose to 2,095 last year, nearly 500 more than in 2008. It is testament to grinding tenacity on all sides that as this project has been considered and reconsidered, Vancouver hosted the Olympics, had a real estate-fuelled recovery from the global recession, endured five years of a worsening opioid overdose epidemic, and now weathers a pandemic. It’s also proof of dismal political leadership that from soon after the city gained the site in a land swap with Concord Pacific, there has been consensus that 58 West Hastings must have housing for the poorest. In 2011, theChinatown Foundationbegan raising $30 million for supportive housing that was the genesis of the plan for a 10-storey building where half of the units would rent for the shelter rate of $375 a month and the remainder would be geared to the income of those earning less than $67,500 a year. But what set the ground for the battle was a promise signed in 2016 on the steps of the Carnegie Community Centre by then-Mayor Gregor Robertson. He agreed that the development would provide housing only for people on welfare or disability pensions. Soon after the promise was signed, Robertson and his Vision council broke it because, although the city owns the property, it hasn’t the money to build or operate on it. Vision was decimated in the 2018 election, but among the first things Mayor Kennedy Stewart and his council did was raise advocates’ hopes again. They asked the city’s administration to see if it was possible to have more than half of the units at shelter and pension-rate. Jean Swanson, a long-time homeless advocate, was the only one opposed. She wanted all or nothing. For many homeless advocates, the foundation’s project has been seen as an over-reach beyond the historic community’s boundaries and a front for what they saw as more gentrification. For the foundation, helping the Downtown Eastside is seen as essential to Chinatown’s revitalization aspirations. “Everything we are doing right relates to building community,” said Carol Lee, the foundation’s chair. “Underpinning what the Chinatown Foundation is doing is answering the question of how do we weave back the social fabric of the city?” Despite city council’s direction to the administration, the bottom line was that if all 230 units were at the low-income rates, the project would have an annual deficit starting at $2 million. Both B.C. Housing and CMHC balked at taking that on. So the plan was modified slightly. Now, 117 units will rent for the welfare shelter rate that is currently $375 a month. The other 113 will have rent geared to income. The rent paid by Vancouver Coastal Health for the 50,000-square-foot health facility will help offset the costs of a building that will also have an enclosed children’s play area, shared amenity spaces, garden plots, and services provided by some of the dozens of community groups such as Dress for Success that have signed on as partners. “I just hope that people understand that what we are trying to create is a safe and welcoming space and not just a roof over people’s heads,” Lee said in an interview. “We want it to be a model of what social housing can look like.” Whether it can be remains to be seen since it’s the model rejected by activists over the past decade as they have marched on and occupied City Hall and taken over parks for tent encampments. Even if this is not a model that works for all, if it works for some, providing them with homes to rebuild their lives, it is part of a long-delayed start on mending the frayed holes in Vancouver’s social fabric. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
94,,"British Columbians are more likely to say they intend to get a COVID-19 vaccine than Canadians as a whole, according toa Leger Survey. In B.C., 82 per cent of people surveyed say they’ll take a jab of a Health Canada-approved vaccine. Nationally, 73 per cent of Canadians say they’ll get vaccinated to protect themselves against SARS-CoV-2. In Ontario, 71 per cent said they would get vaccinated; the lowest region was in Manitoba and Saskatchewan at 70 per cent. Leger’s North American Trackeralso found that 50 per cent of Canadians were prepared to take the first vaccine available; in B.C., it was 63 per cent. Heather Owen, Leger’s vice-president in Vancouver, said both figures should be seen in the context of data collected for anational polland not a regional one. “To me those intended behaviours speak to a few things,” she said. “B.C. has consistently shown some of the highest trust in our public health officer and in the province’s actions to manage the pandemic. British Columbians believe the government is doing the right thing.“ Overall, she said, British Columbians show trust in how provincial leaders are dealing with the pandemic. She said the recent provincial election that saw voters elect an NDP majority was a validation of the government’s efforts and reflected a “belief that this is the team that will see us through the pandemic.” “That was a pandemic election and there’s a lot of trust in (Premier) John Horgan and (provincial health officer) Dr. Bonnie Henry especially,” Owen said. She said Henry’s brand recognition is 90 per cent in B.C. Consistently, eight-of-10 British Columbians support what she and Health Minister Adrian Dix are doing when it comes to COVID-19. “There is a real belief that she is doing what she should do to keep us safe and to make sure we get vaccinated,” she said. Aseparate Leger pollreleased in early February based on data collected in late January found that 55 per cent of respondents said they were satisfied with the B.C. government’s performance, down 14 points from Jan. 18. Satisfaction with measures taken by government were highest on June 15, 2020, at 92 per cent. Overall, 73 per cent of Canadians plan to get vaccinated. That’s up seven per cent. In the U.S., the figure is 56 per cent. “We have three-quarters of Canadians and just over half of Americans having the intention to take the first vaccine,” Owen said. She said the numbers indicate to her that there is a growing willingness to trust in what’s being offered and less second-guessing about the pandemic. Every two weeks, thetracker surveysa representative sample of 1,535 Canadians and 1,002 Americans.

95,"Feb 16, 2021","A Mission woman who travelled to her Arizona winter home less than a month ago has cut her trip short and is scrambling to get home before all air travellers entering Canada will have to quarantine at designated hotels at their own expense. “I’m quite a bit nervous,” said Glenda Kerr, who usually spends winters in a community of Canadian snowbirds near Phoenix. “It’s a big mess.” Kerr, whose husband died last year after a short sickness, flew on Jan. 25 to the home to take care of the banking paperwork that she said had to be done in-person. Four days later, the federal government announced it would implement the three-day stay while travellers waited for a negative test result and the estimated $2,000 per person would be paid by the traveller. Kerr said she was in the minority at her snowbird community when it was announced on Friday that the new rules will take effect Monday. “I am leaving but nobody else seems to be,” she said. “They’re saying, ‘They can drag me kicking and screaming from here and what they’re doing is taking me hostage.’ ” One Vancouver travel agency says more of its snowbird clients are choosing to stay in Arizona, Florida or Mexico rather than rush back. “Many of our clients, we’ve contacted them, and they decided to stay put and extend their stay,” said BeeBee Prangchan of Uniglobe Travel. “They’re hoping the restrictions will be eased up by then. They say they want to stay because the winter has been brutal (in Canada) anyway.” They’re planning to stay until April or May, she said, and saying, “We’ll deal with it then.” Kerr’s plan to return is turning into an expensive logistical nightmare. Rather than pay United Airlines $800 to change her flight, she cancelled it for a credit and rebooked on American Airlines. She has to have a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test done in the 72 hours before departure, a condition of travel, which in her case is Thursday. “I’m having a hell of a time finding a PCR COVID test,” she said. “I can go spend $200 (US) and get one and there’s no guarantee that I will get the results in time,” she said. Plus, she’s worried about getting a false positive. She said there is a testing station at the airport that offers a rapid test for US$150 but she’s afraid even if it’s OK to board the American Airlines flight that it won’t be good enough for the Canadian border requirement. Kerr said if she can’t get back to Canada before Monday, should would consider flying into Bellingham, Wash., and taking a cab to the border and walking over. Travellers at land border crossings aren’t required to quarantine in hotels for three days, but they do need a PCR. “I don’t know what will happen if I don’t get this COVID test,” she said. “And when you start adding up health insurance (paid for and not used), COVID tests, the changes to flights, the $2,000 hotel rooms, it really adds up,” she said. Kerr also said it’s difficult to find accurate information online on how to apply for an exemption (she needs to get back to take care of an ailing elderly relative) and said many of her fellow snowbirds weren’t aware of the new restrictions until she told them. Some have told her they heard that anyone who owns property outside of Canada would be exempt from the $2,000 fee (which isn’t true). Dr. Valorie Crooks, a Simon Fraser University geography professor who studies snowbirds, said the mostly retired and elderly travellers have misconceptions about their health risks. “They feel as though they’re living with less risk abroad than they would be at home,” she said. She said there is a lack of public health messaging that has targeted that demographic and they may have received mixed messaging about travelling south during the pandemic because the travel insurance industry marketed special COVID-19 insurance to them. Snowbirds often factor health into their travel plans and they may have weighed the risks and benefits and decided to go, she said. The Canadian Snowbirds Association in a letter this month to the federal transport minister said it was “firmly opposed” to the mandatory hotel quarantine and said travellers should be allowed to quarantine at home. “To force Canadians to pay over $2,000 for three nights of accommodation in a government-approved hotel is unreasonable and will be a financial hardship for many,” said CEO Karen Huestis in a letter posted to the association’s website."
96,"Feb 15, 2021","Aging can affect the quality of life for older people in many ways. Now anosmia — losing the sense of smell, which is a symptom of COVID-19 — can put seniors off their sex life, a new study shows. A group of researchers, along with an expert from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, came up with the findings after testing a sample of 2,084 seniors over the age of 65. They found a sense of smell plays a pivotal role in sexual motivation, the U.K.Daily Mailreported. Other research concluded smell disorder in older patients impairs their sexual life. “Decreased olfactory function in older U.S. adults was associated with decreased sexual motivation and less emotional satisfaction with sex, but not decreased frequency of sexual activity or physical pleasure,” the researchers said in their paper published in theJournal of Sexual Medicine. The group of researchers suggests a decrease in smell didn’t necessarily decrease the frequency of sexual activity in all. “Our research shows a decline in olfactory function may affect sexual pleasure in older adults,” said study author Jesse K. Siegel at the University of Chicago. “Therefore, treatable causes of sensory loss should be addressed by clinicians to improve sexual health.” Researchers say this is possibly because of ‘evolutionarily-conserved’ neurological links between olfaction and sexuality. “Olfaction has a strong, evolutionary-conserved connection to the limbic system, which plays a critical role in processing emotions and sexual motivation,” Siegel and her team say in their paper. “Neurons in the olfactory bulb also project directly to the hypothalamus, another key mediator of sexual motivation.” kconnor@postmedia.com"
97,"Feb 12, 2021","When B.C.’s seniors advocate asked for new Pharmacare statistics on how many care home residents were given antipsychotic and antidepressant medications in 2020, while COVID-19 wreaked havoc on the facilities, she discovered an alarming line on a graph shooting upward. “It is getting worse,” Isobel Mackenzie said. “I’m very concerned.” In response to a Postmedia query, Mackenzie asked for Pharmacare data until the end of December, and found the continuation of a disturbing pattern for which she hadfirst raised alarm bells last year: Despite years of effort to reduce the use of these drugs on seniors without an accompanying diagnosis of psychosis or depression, care homes — which were hit hard by COVID — turned to them again in 2020. “COVID wiped out all the gains,” the worried advocate said. A graph of the data shows relatively flat lines between the end of 2018 and February 2020, when roughly 30 per cent of care home residents were dispensed antipsychotics and just over half received antidepressants. But since March 2020, when the virus began to infiltrate some care homes, there was a steady increase in their use right up to December. Separate health assessment data shows no appreciable increase in diagnoses for conditions that require antipsychotic medication, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, which suggests what the industry calls a “potentially inappropriate” use of the drugs. In these circumstances, they are typically used to control residents’ behaviour or some type of agitation, Mackenzie said. It’s impossible right now, she said, to give a definitive answer for why this is happening. But she notes the prescriptions increased when the pandemic arrived. “So, what changed then? Well, (family) visitors have been severely restricted. Staff have been under stress. Some care homes have experienced an outbreak,” she said. “It’s unclear how much physicians have re-engaged with going on site to care homes versus giving verbal orders over the phone.” The Pharmacare data shows an eight-per-cent increase in the use of antipsychotics by the end of 2020. With more than 27,500 publicly subsidized care home beds, that could translate into 825 more residents receiving these powerful drugs last year. There was a four-per-cent increase in residents getting antidepressants, potentially representing another 550 seniors being doped up on new drugs. The pandemic could lead to more people being depressed, Mackenzie said, which could partly explain the rise in this second set of numbers. The percentage of care home residents receiving neither of these drugs was improving until mid-2019, when, according to Pharmacare data, it started to slip a bit. But then in March 2020, there was a dramatic eight-per-cent drop in the number of seniors receiving neither of these drugs. By December, two out of every three care home residents was receiving at least one of these medications. “All of these factors have gone in the wrong direction,” Mackenzie said. One Postmedia reader said his mother, who is in her 80s, has dementia, but he discovered last year that her Victoria-area care home was giving her a drug intended to treat bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. The man, who asked to remain anonymous so his mother wouldn’t face repercussions in her care home, said staff told him she was given the drug “to help make (her) more manageable.” But when he Googled the drug, the manufacturer warned it “should not be used to treat behavioural problems in older adult patients who have dementia.” “I noticed she was becoming more and more zombie like,” the man said. After he complained, he said the home significantly reduced or possibly stopped using the drug on his mother. “Has she ever changed again. I mean, she was almost completely non-responsive before, non-animated,” he said, adding it is hard for families to watch over their loved ones when visitations were curtailed drastically last year. The Canadian Institute for Health Information raised concerns about this issue last year, but its data was from 2019-’20, so does not reflect how things might have worsened during the pandemic. It foundone out of every five residentsin a Canadian care home was taking antipsychotic drugs without a psychosis diagnosis. That worsened to one out of every four residents in British Columbia, which had the highest rate of the “potentially inappropriate use of antipsychotics” of all provinces. Mackenzie’s latest annual report, also based on 2019-20 data from before the pandemic, further found that in 56 of B.C.’s 296 publicly funded care homes, at least one third of the seniors were given antipsychotic medications without a diagnosis. B.C. began efforts to change its reliance on these drugs in 2012, with new Ministry of Health guidelines for doctors and other health-care workers to reduce these prescriptions. The government also created the CLeAR — Call for Less Antipsychotics in Residential Care — project to help long-term care homes find other ways to treat dementia patients. And the B.C. Care Providers Association — which represents organizations that have government contracts to run care beds — issued its own antipsychotic best-practices guide around that same time. Those efforts appeared to be working before the pandemic arrived. In her latest annual report, Mackenzie said there had been a steady, four-year decline in homes using antipsychotics and antidepressants on residents without diagnoses for those ailments: from 27 per cent in 2015-16 to 24 per cent in 2018-19. There was a slight increase in 2019-20, which worried Mackenzie because it meant nearly a quarter of all care home residents in B.C. were on these powerful drugs without actually having a psychosis. There was no similar improvement over those five years when it came to antidepressant medication. Mackenzie’s annual report found the proportion of care home residents with a depression diagnosis remained stable at less than a quarter, but nearly half of them were on antidepressant medication. The data in Mackenzie’s last report ended in March 2020, when COVID-19 began to creep into care homes. She does not yet have her own statistics for 2020-21, but she believes there will be a sizable uptick in prescriptions without a diagnosis based on what she’s seeing from the Pharmacare data for the year 2020. “It is very clear the degree to which we’ve seen significant increases in antipsychotics and antidepressants, and a decrease in the proportion of residents that get neither,” she said. Karen Biggs, the CEO of Menno Place in Abbotsford, has worked in the care home sector for 42 years, and said there have been long-term efforts to reduce the use of these drugs. Her home, based on Mackenzie’s annual report statistics, is one of the best in the province, with only nine per cent of residents getting an antipsychotic or antidepressant without a diagnosis in 2019/20. She doesn’t know yet if that percentage will be higher or lower during the pandemic year, but strongly argues that COVID-19 has moved the goalposts for care homes during this deadly pandemic, and that staff are doing the best they can under trying circumstances. “This year has been hell on wheels,” she said. “The year has been difficult on staff and residents … The isolation from their families increased, and depression. Especially with 85 per cent of our clients having dementia, they don’t understand where their kids are, they don’t understand where their grandkids are. They just know they’re not here.” An estimated two-thirds of the more than 1,270 COVID deaths in B.C. have been in care homes, and there have been more than 225 outbreaks at these facilities since March. Biggs had one outbreak among her home’s 700 residents, who range from seniors living independently to complex-care cases in the site’s hospital, in November. In her home and others, she said, the crisis response to the outbreak often puts their regular procedures on the back burner: Seniors are confined to their rooms. Staff drop by less because they have to don and doff full PPE each time. Maybe medications are checked less. “In our home, we have been trying hard to reduce those antipsychotic numbers. But the normal work goes away, the physicians aren’t coming on site. So med reviews are done on Zoom calls or put off because we’re under outbreak,” she said. “The normal work gets disturbed by the essence of the outbreak situation.” Staffing also was a major challenge. For example, a nurse with dementia expertise was forced to cohort on another floor at Menno when the outbreak occurred, so nurses who knew less about dementia patients had to cover for her. As a “last resort,” a replacement nurse might try these meds to calm an upset patient, and it’s difficult during these situations to get feedback from physicians who might only be available on Zoom, said Biggs. “If you don’t know the clients as well, you may have a tendency to try medication, because you don’t know what else works,” said Biggs, who is a nurse. “Nursing doesn’t like to use chemical restraints. That’s really something that we’ve worked very hard in the industry to reduce.” Long before the pandemic, Biggs said, Menno reduced its reliance on these drugs by making several changes, such as bringing in younger, family practice doctors who were less inclined to prescribe these meds and having on-site pharmacists who flag when they think prescriptions should be changed or reduced. Biggs, who is on a regular Zoom call with about 40 other care home operators, believes that when the pandemic ends, these medication numbers will improve again. “Everybody’s exhausted with people going off with stress and illness. This has been a very, very tough year,” she said. “We’ve had to change our whole approach to everything.” The provincial government funds 27,500 beds in 296 seniors’ homes. Just over one third of those are run by health authorities, while the remainder are contracted out to either for-profit or not-for-profit organizations. Menno is one of the non-profit, contracted homes. The data in Mackenzie’s annual report shows that while the contracted homes do not fare as well as the health-authority-run ones in several key categories, they do slightly better when it comes to not overusing these meds: 27 per cent of residents in health authority-run homes were given these drugs without a diagnosis in 2019-’20, compared to 23 per cent in the privately run facilities. Part of the reason for this, Mackenzie said, is health authority homes take more complex residents because of their access to more medical-care options. Among the top 25 care homes with the worst four-year average for the overuse of these drugs, four were run by Vancouver Coastal Health. VCH did not provide someone to be interviewed, but in a statement said that before the pandemic, it had examined antipsychotic use in long-term care and developed a “strategic directive” to tackle it. It was also working on a “culture change,” intended to reduce the loneliness and isolation faced by care home residents, but did not provide details. Since the arrival of COVID, VCH has “created a guideline document focused on how we can support individuals as a team with a care plan and a goal of reducing antipsychotic and antidepressant medications where clinically possible,” the statement said. VCH also said that many of its care homes with the highest prescribing stats have “specialized populations” with more complex needs. And compared to the contracted homes, those run by the health authority may have been more disadvantaged by visitor restrictions as well as the reduced access to mental health services for residents. Interior Health and Northern Health also had several homes that gave these drugs to a high percentage of residents, but neither of those health authorities responded to requests for comment. In 2018, the B.C. Care Providers Association produceda documentfor its members that explained how some homes had reduced their “potentially inappropriate use of psychotics.” The solutions included increased staff training, regular medication reviews, getting family consent, pet therapy and robotic cats, and a “sensory room” with soft music and bubbles. Despite the gains made by some homes, the industry’s report acknowledged the challenge remains. “The excessive use of antipsychotics to treat behavioural and psychological symptoms … in people with dementia, particularly in care homes, continues to be identified as a key action area for improvement, and is essential to improving the quality of life for seniors.” Today, the CEO of the Care Providers Association is Terry Lake.In 2016, when Postmedia first wrote about this problem, he was the provincial health minister and insisted the industry must “reduce the unnecessary use of medication.” He also oversaw new training for care home staff and a “hugs not drugs” strategy. In an interview this week, Lake said he hasn’t seen any first-hand evidence that the use of antipsychotics increased last year, beyond the data gathered by the advocate. However, he acknowledged it could have happened, because it was a very difficult time for many seniors. “Many residents don’t understand all of the things that are happening around them in terms of the pandemic’s infection, prevention and control practices. So I think there’s probably many reasons why we might see the use of antipsychotics go up. And it’s an unfortunate sequela, or byproduct, of the COVID situation in long-term care,” he said. Lake, who was a Liberal MLA, is critical of some of the policies of this NDP government. He believes expanding family visits and rapid testing of staff for COVID-19 would have improved situations in some care homes. “I think that is part of the reason we’re seeing antipsychotic use go up, is that people are separated from their loved ones,” he said. “And then, of course, care staff are worked off their feet. So … maybe, like a lot of us, they turn to easy answers. And sometimes that’s the use of drugs rather than behavioural sort of approaches.” With care home residents and staff being a top priority for the vaccine rollout, the hope is that outbreaks will soon be a thing of the past at care homes. Then, Lake said, operators will once again have time to tackle the use of antipsychotics. Why is the overuse of these drugs important? Because, Mackenzie said, their side effects can mimic behaviours associated with dementia. And once care home residents become inactive and apathetic, it can be harder to pull them out of that spiral. “We need to be careful that we don’t ascribe a person’s behaviours, or desires, to the aging process or cognitive decline, when, in fact, what you’re seeing is a side effect of the medication,” she said. In the meantime, she will be watching, as vaccines are given to care home residents, staff and visitors, whether families will be able to visit more frequently and more comprehensively, as bothshe and B.C.’s ombudsperson Jay Chalke have demanded. She hopes more interaction with loved ones will improve seniors’ behaviours, and ideally lead to a reduction in these problematic prescriptions. “When we turn the corner on that in a meaningful way, we need to see if these numbers start coming down. If they don’t, then we need to start looking at revisiting what our medication orders are.” lculbert@postmedia.com — With data analysis by Nathan Griffiths,ngriffiths@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

98,"Feb 10, 2021","In the darkness of the second winter of the pandemic, Daniela Gunn-Doerge had a simple thought: “What can we do to lift people’s spirits?” Gunn-Doerge, 28, outreach coordinator at Mt. Pleasant Neighbourhood House, rallied a few volunteers to make Valentine’s for seniors isolated in nearby long-term care homes. “I thought we would touch base with two or three care homes in the area,” said Gunn-Doerge. Word spread, and 15 long-term care homes and two geriatric hospitals asked to be included. Volunteers, too, leapt at the opportunity. Her goal — 200 handmade Valentines — became 400, then 2,000, as people of all ages offered their time and talent. Gunn-Doerge quickly realized the benefits of this growing “heart-storm” wasn’t just for the recipients. It was also for the makers. “People were calling up and saying I’ve been so lonely, I’ve been feeling the heaviness of this winter, even the idea that I could make a Valentine for someone would lift me up,” said Gunn-Doerge. “One older man who called me said he’s been living with chronic pain for years and years, he’s an artist but he’s been quite alone. The idea of doing something creative for others in similar isolation was really moving for him.” A support group for kids battling cancer, whose support group had been relegated to Zoom, reached out to say they themselves were struggling with physical illness, and that it would help them to do something to give back. “They wanted to show that they aren’t just the receivers of help and care, but that they can also give care to others.” And a dear friend, pregnant, isolated and unable to celebrate her pregnancy with friends and family, began to send Gunn-Doerge videos of herself making Valentines at home, “It was a reminder to her that she is part of a community, even if some days it doesn’t feel that way.” Gunn-Doerge realized that every act of creation became a reminder to the maker of kindness. As they drew pictures and glued ruffled doilies and wrote messages meant to bring a smile to a stranger, they felt a sense of connection, that link that’s been missing for all of us. “The small act of creating a card has a huge impact on both the maker of the card and the receiver of the card,” said Gunn-Doerge. Eight or nine schools and a Girl Guide troop joined the Valentine forces. A Korean church group stepped up to make Valentines in their own language for a care home with 74 Korean residents. “We’ve left it open to people’s creativity, whatever feels inspiring to them, whether it’s a letter, a poem, a traditional card, a finger painting, as long as the message is legible for the seniors,” said Dunn-George. “The message we want to send is that no matter who you are, we are sending love because we are all in this together.” Some will be hand delivered, others will be posted on windows and walls of facilities based on their COVID safety regulations. “I don’t think Valentine’s Day has to be about romantic love. It can be about loving your friends or your family, and this year most importantly it’s about loving your neighbours, the ones you know, the ones you don’t know and especially the ones that are all alone.” dryan@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

99,,"Only a small fraction of B.C.’s supply of rapid COVID-19 tests has been distributed, prompting those who care for high risk individuals to plea for the remaining stock lest it sit unused and eventually expire. As of a month ago, just 230,000 tests had trickled out for use in outbreak response and for pilot projects in jails, care homes and remote communities, according to Health Ministry figures. But B.C. received at least 1.3 million tests from the federal government. Terry Lake, the head of the B.C. Care Providers Association and apersistent advocate for regular use of rapid tests in care homes, wrote to Health Minister Adrian Dix late last month asking for the unused kits. At the time, officials did not seem to be embracing the use of rapid tests on a widespread basis, Lake said. “We thought, well, why are we waiting for the government to help us do this? They’ve got the tests, just give the tests to us and we’ll do them,” he said. Dix has not yet responded to the letter, but Lake said he is not surprised. Being a former health minister himself, he noted it does take time for correspondence to work its way through the bureaucracy and for any plans to be formed. “We’re trying to read the tea leaves, and so we parse everything that (the provincial health officer, Bonnie Henry) and the minister says,” Lake said. “We just want to shake this thing loose.” Henry has beencool to the use of rapid tests, arguing that they’re less sensitive and still require a health worker to administer. But she has also they can be useful in rapidly detecting outbreaks, and the province is looking atsettings where they could be useful, such as remote communities and in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. B.C.’s public health leaders endorsed a strategy of starting with pilot projects and evaluating their results, staff at the Health Ministry said. Some positive cases have already been identified at pilot sites, according to the ministry. David Hurford is the CEO of the Three Links Care Society, a non-profit long-term care home that last week joined an rapid testing pilot. Under the program, staff members at Three Links are being rapid tested once or twice a week on a voluntary basis. They are not required to come in early for the testing, and the results come in before they even hit the work floor, Hurford said. “For me, if we just find one case it will be all worth it. And I think our staff feel that way, too, because we know what one case can do. We know what one asymptomatic case can do in a long-term care home if you don’t catch it quick. And it’s awful. Nobody wants to go through that again,” Hurford said. Dozens of staff members jumped in line to get rapid tested once it became available, and there were two reasons for that, Hurford said. “The care aides are so selfless. … When you talk to (them) about what they’re most afraid of, they say ‘it’s not me getting COVID, it’s me bringing COVID into the home and not knowing it,’ or they’re scared to death of taking COVID home to their family.” The testing process is not difficult for health care professionals to perform once they’re familiar with the process, Hurford said. Asked whether he thought other facilities might also benefit from the technology, Hurford said he did. “I just wish we had them a lot sooner,” he said. mrobinson@postmedia.com"
100,"Feb 09, 2021","The genesis of Canada’s homeless crisis dates back six decades to a time when the novelOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nestdebuted and there was a growing consensus that it was inhumane and abhorrent to lock mentally ill people in institutions. Across North America, the doors began opening and institutions began to be shuttered. Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam was finally closed in 2012. But almost immediately, there were calls for at least parts of it to be reopened. It’s a debate that has not ended. That debate continues because we are now living with the consequences of the unfulfilled promise made when Riverview closed — that services for the mentally ill would be as readily available in the community as they are for the physically ill. “There were significant blunders made, like blowing up all the buildings at Riverview, even though a lot of it was well-intentioned,” Alex Berland, Riverview’s last administrator, told me recently. Among the failures was that there was too much focus on the physical infrastructure and not enough on “the central element of making these things successful.” The central element? People trained to do the work of caring and supporting the various sub-populations of people with mental illnesses. There was a misunderstanding of the needs of the various sub-populations that range from those capable of living independently with minimal supports to the most profoundly ill in need of 24/7 residential care. At Riverview, the latter filled two wards — one for 20 to 24 men, and another for 20 to 24 women. Because of brain damage suffered at birth, brain injuries later in life, fetal alcohol syndrome, developmental disabilities, mental illness and addiction, they were deemed untreatable. Those wards required one staff person for every two patients, some of whom were so violent that they had to be shackled to their beds. “They were not ideal conditions. But they weren’t cold and miserable like they are on the street,” said Berland, who trained as a nurse before getting his master’s degree in health services planning and administration. Yet, the street is where some likely ended up after being deemed too disruptive and too difficult to handle in the smaller community facilities with less staff to deal with them. At one associated facility, Valley View, Berland said there were close to 300 elderly people who could hardly communicate because of dementia resulting from age or decades of pharmaceutical treatment for their mental illness. Others at Riverview with brain injuries couldn’t function on their own. But there, they had gardens, a gymnasium, as well as recreational and vocational training not available to them when they were transferred to smaller homes. What happened to all those people and others like them since Riverview’s closure? Nobody seems to know. “There’s not a lot of good data collection going on,” Berland said. “And what there is, is not being shared.” The Building Community Society recently made the same point in a presentation to provincial Housing Minister David Eby, calling data gathering “sparse” with organizations like Vancouver Coastal Health, B.C. Housing and the City of Vancouver often refusing to share what they have. It’s astounding considering that, with the exception of the city, those organizations plus hundreds of other non-profits providing mental health supports and housing get most of their money from the provincial government. Without that evidence, it is impossible to know what’s working, what’s not, what money is being well spent and what’s wasted. It’s why one of the society’s recommendations is for a single entity to do just that. With evidence, B.C. would be long past the pilot projects and trial stage. But it’s not. Last month, the B.C. Urban Mayors’ Caucus agreed to work with the provincial government to get pilot projects in several communities — two in the Lower Mainland and one in each of the other four regions — up and running by the end of this year. Planned are 40- to 50-bed, complex-care facilities for the hardest to house. That’s double the size of what the Building Community Society has proposed for the 300 or so most desperate, visibly distressed, often violent and preyed-upon homeless people on Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. The society’s members (who include psychiatrist Bill MacEwan and former premier Mike Harcourt) propose a 20-bed hospital unit called a Welcome Centre for assessment and initial treatment staffed by three outreach teams who will be able to, on demand, get patients into detox, followed by a range of treatment options from residential to community recovery care that would place them on the rungs of a ladder to the most appropriate kind of housing to suit their needs. The project is similar, but still different from the evidence of a four-year, federal government trial calledAt Home/Chez Soicompleted in 2014. No new facilities were built to accommodate 100 of Vancouver’s hardest to house. The focus was on providing the human resources to support their needs after they were moved from the streets into existing buildings that had no more than 20 per cent of the residents with similar mental health issues. The residents thrived and, over two years, for every $10 invested in support services for high-needs participants, $8.55 was saved. Critics of the proposed five-site trial say it’s Riverview-lite. But in a pandemic with a critical shortage of trained health-care workers, it’s more likely to be post-Riverview redux — buildings built without the human resources to make the experiment work. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
101,"Feb 08, 2021","B.C.’s ombudsperson is calling on the province to make its policy on long-term care visits fair and consistent after receiving complaints from those trying to see loved ones during the pandemic. Jay Chalke said Monday he welcomes the provincial health officer’s recent order that legally requires all long-term care homes to apply the visitor policy issued last month by the Health Ministry. While Dr. Bonnie Henry’s order expressly anticipates changes to the policy may be needed, Chalke said he wants the ministry to make improvements because of his concerns about how it’s being implemented. He called for mandatory timelines for decisions made by facility staff on requests for visits as well as for each stage of an appeals process. Care homes should also provide written reasons when visits are denied or restricted, he added. “These shortcomings are unnecessarily amplifying an already difficult situation,” he said in a news release. COVID-19 hit dozens of long-term care homes in the province and the outbreaks are responsible for the majority of deaths since the pandemic began. Seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie said all care-home residents are entitled to an essential visitor but some are only allowed one “designated” or social visitor who is denied access to the resident’s room. Mackenzie said the decision on visitors should be left up to residents or whoever speaks for them, which she highlighted in a report in November. “What we have is guidelines in place that allow for an essential visitor, but that does not guarantee that a resident will be allowed the essential visitor,” she said Monday. The public health order issued Friday stipulates that residents who have an essential visitor should also get a designated or social visitor, Mackenzie said, adding the issue has caused confusion for care-home operators and the Fraser Health Authority in particular. Mackenzie said families that have not been allowed an essential visitor have called her office to express their frustration and she’s concerned that those who have always helped feed and care for their loved ones have been treated as “an issue to be managed.”"
102,"Feb 07, 2021","There aren’t just cracks that people are falling through because of the inadequacy of B.C.’s social safety net. There are chasms. A mother wrote to me about her 32-year-old son who is on the bipolar spectrum and has been on a disability pension since he was 20. He is living with her because even after 12 years on B.C. Housing’s registry, he has never got a call. “Nothing ever comes up because he’s not on the street or at (hospital) emergency on a regular basis,” wrote the mom, who asked that their names not be used because of her son’s paranoia. Community mental health teams have refused to work with him because the pharmaceuticals he has tried don’t work for him and he won’t try any more. Cognitive-behavioural therapy is often recommended. But psychiatrists who are covered by the provincial health plan don’t do it. Psychologists who do aren’t covered by medicare. “I suppose it’s one battle at a time, but this one (psychologists not being covered) really irks when mental health issues are only rising during a pandemic,” she said. There is another hitch, even for those who can afford it. “No Canadian province or territory has established standards for accrediting (cognitive-behavioural therapy) practitioners,” according to the B.C. Partners for Mental Health and Substance Use Information, which is funded by the Provincial Health Services Authority. “For now, there is no easy way for people who are seeking treatment to find out how qualified or skilled a particular practitioner is in (cognitive-behavioural therapy).” Without her help, the mother bluntly says that her son would be on the street and likely dead by now. I also heard from a father whose son has schizophrenia. He has overdosed on fentanyl a dozen times in the past 12 months and been revived with naloxone. He’s known to police and was recently charged. His parents were forced to get a peace bond to keep him away from their home because he has broken in so often. They try hard to maintain contact, but they just can’t let him into their home. There are thousands of British Columbians who are homeless, mentally ill and addicted. It is generally agreed that this is the tragic legacy of the closure of Riverview Hospital, a provincial institution for those with mental illness, without properly funded housing and supports to replace it. The phase-out began four decades ago, and it finally closed in 2012. But it’s over those decades that people have been falling through the cracks and dying of neglect. Of the homeless, an estimated two per cent have profound mental illness usually coupled with addiction. That means as many as 300 in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside alone. Here’s another chilling statistic: Of the homeless, it is estimated that 27 per cent have traumatic brain injuries sustained at birth, due to an accident, or, increasingly, from having been revived from an opioid overdose. Attorney-General David Eby describes the whole disconnected mess as “a legacy challenge.” And it was dumped on his desk when Premier John Horgan’smandate lettermade Eby the Minister-of-Almost-Everything-But-COVID. He is now responsible for developing a homelessness strategy, increasing supports for people with mental illness and addictions including better access to nurses and psychiatrists, more supportive housing, more affordable housing, more help for Indigenous people both on and off reserve, and a whole bunch of other stuff related to condo insurance, renter protection, housing affordability and drug decriminalization. In an interview, Eby acknowledged that it’s “a fairly big assumption,” for example, that someone coming out of detox will immediately get into treatment. And after treatment, getting appropriate housing “is really speculative at best.” Beyond that, “People age out of one program, but they’re not old enough for another. The gaps in services really eat a lot of people up.” Disjointed and inadequate as the services and supports were before COVID, social distancing requirements have only made it worse. Violence and chaos on Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside has increased, with those problems migrating to other parts of the city. Smaller cities are also facing growing challenges from homeless camps and unprovoked violent attacks. “It’s pretty terrible when you’re struck by the jarring reality that people are living in, because a homeless shelter or the drop-in centre is closed due to COVID,” Eby said. “In some ways, although it’s horrific and the suffering is profound, this is what was necessary for everyone to say ‘enough’.” But solutions are slow and, for many, unsatisfactory. The province has already bought or rented unused hotels in Vancouver and Victoria, and an old brewery in Kelowna. It will be April before people from the Strathcona Park homeless camp will be moved to a city-owned motel and a youth hostel. Next month, Victoria’s homeless encampment will be dismantled and people moved to a hockey arena. Building housing takes time and Eby admits frustration with how long approvals take. “I’m spending a lot of time writing to cities asking them to please approve this housing.” Building housing is a start. But it doesn’t begin to address pressing human resources questions. Is complex mental health care affordable outside of congregate housing? Are there enough trained people to manage supportive housing for the mentally ill and addicted? Are there enough psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and others to care for the most desperately in need? And if not, where are they going to come from? Those are questions for another day. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter:@bramham_daphne"
103,,"Fraser Health says patients at the Irene Thomas Hospice in Delta will have to transfer as the health authority prepares to take over from operators who refused to provide medical assistance in dying. It says in a statement the Delta Hospice Society had asked the health authority last month to begin the transition of clinical operations for the 10-bed hospice so patients would not have to move elsewhere. Fraser Health says it sent a letter to the hospice society on Jan. 26 outlining proposed arrangements, but last Tuesday the society responded indicating its unwillingness to agree to the terms. The health authority says its plan had aimed to “ensure a safe and orderly transition and to continue to provide hospice services onsite.” The hospice society says it agreed to seamlessly transition operation of the hospice, but that it does not agree with the health authority’s plan to take over operating the Harold and Veronica Savage Centre for Supportive Care, which is on the same land lease. The society says the centre provides specialized care for people living with cancer and other serious illnesses, as well as those mourning a sudden death — services it says the health authority is not prepared to offer. Fraser Health says hospice patients may decide to transfer to a facility of their choice now or wait until closer to Feb. 24. That’s when the service agreement with the hospice society is set to end, and Fraser Health said last month it would serve the society with 30 days’ notice to vacate the property the following day. “Though it is unfortunate the Delta Hospice Society is unwilling to agree to a seamless transition to continue to provide hospice services, they have agreed to vacate the Irene Thomas Hospice,” the health authority says in a statement posted Saturday. Fraser Health says it intends to continue providing beds at the Irene Thomas Hospice in the future and it will pause plans to open hospice beds at Mountain View Manor, a nearby long-term care home. “The comfort and well-being of our hospice patients and their families remains our priority, and we want to ensure hospice beds remain available in the Delta community.” Fraser Health says it provided the required 365 days’ notice to end its service agreement with the hospice society, which refused to comply with a provincial policy requiring hospices to provide assisted death. The agreement included $1.5 million in annual funding covering most of the costs to operate the hospice on health authority-owned land. Delta Mayor George Harvie has said the city wants to become the lease-holder of the hospice building, while Fraser Health says it’s looking forward to discussions about possible options. When layoff notices were issued last month at the hospice, board president Angelina Ireland blamed the provincial government, saying it’s “destroying a sanctuary for dying patients who want the choice to stay in a palliative care facility where (assisted death) is not offered.” Fraser Health says it’s working to ensure all unionized hospice staff who received layoff notices will have the opportunity to work within the health authority if they choose.

104,"Feb 03, 2021","A Parksville couple say they’re “trapped” in their Arizona home and will remain in the U.S. as long as Canada requires them to pay up to $2,000 each for their own quarantine when they return. Ray Moschuk said he and his wife are not vacationing in Scottsdale. “This is our home.” They typically spend six months in the sunny state, broken up into two three-month periods, and left Canada on Dec. 20. They made the trip to tend to their property because they were concerned about its security after someone tried to steal some fixtures. The federal government announced last weekpeople returning from abroad will have to quarantine at hotels for at least three days while awaiting results of a COVID test administered upon arrival, but no date has been set for when this will take effect. The move is one of several measures meant to choke off entry of the virus into Canada, but comes after case numbers of more transmissible variants have begun to rise. Moschuk said there are a number of reasons why he objects to the mandatory three-day quarantine. He said the couple left Canada in “good faith” because Ottawa allowed it. He also said he and his wife are self-quarantining in Scottsdale. “We don’t play pickle ball. We don’t golf, which we love. We’re not out shopping. We’re not going into the pool (at their complex),” he said. “We’re living like we would live in Parksville.” They plan to quarantine when they return at their home in Parksville for 14 days, after driving their car home from the airport, a car that will be stocked with groceries by their friends for their return. It’s what they did when they returned from Arizona in March. “We’re law-abiding people,” he said. But they object to having to stay in a government-mandated hotel for three days or longer at an estimated cost of up to $2,000 each. They worry that staying in a hotel will increase their chances of getting COVID because they will be housed in a small space, just as seniors are in long-term care homes where there have been outbreaks. “We’re trapped down here (in Scottsdale) and we’re waiting for common sense to prevail in Canada,” he said. Moschuk also said there is no evidence that international travellers are spreading COVID, with the majority coming from community spread. He also questioned Canada’s legal right to penalize its own citizens and said the government was unfairly targeting seniors. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday “rare exceptions” to the new travel restrictions will be made on compassionate grounds, but that more contagious COVID-19 variants now taking hold in Canada mean tough rules must be implemented in the next few weeks. “Since the beginning of this pandemic there have been stories of funerals that haven’t been able to be held, weddings had to (be) put off or done by Zoom, families not being able to get together,” Trudeau said at a news conference Tuesday. “But at the same time our responsibility is to make sure we’re keeping Canadians as safe as possible. These new variants out there are of real concern,” he said. Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, says at least 148 cases of the variants that emerged in the United Kingdom and South Africa have been confirmed across the country, even as the number of COVID-19 cases continue to decline.

105,"Jan 26, 2021","The U.S. pharmaceutical company Moderna says it plans to begin human studies of a booster shot for its vaccine to boost protection against a more transmissible variant of the virus. Even at lower antibody levels, the existing vaccine should offer protection against the strain first seen in South Africa, Moderna said Monday. But a test showed Moderna’s existing vaccine may be less potent against that strain, Reuters reported. As of Thursday, theB.C. Centre of Disease Controlidentified three cases of the South African variant, officially named 501Y.V2. The source is unknown as no travel outside Canada has been associated with the cases. The Centre also identified six confirmed cases of variant B.1.1.7 which was first reported in December in the United Kingdom. Four of the infected B.C. people reported travel outside of the country, while the two other were close contacts, the Centre said. Postmedia talked toHoracio Bach, an infectious disease specialist who works in the University of B.C.’s faculty of medicine. He’s manager of antibody engineering at the Jack Bell Centre. A:Viruses are mutating and changing all the time. If the sequence is beneficial, the virus will continue. A variant can be more transmissible and lead to faster infection. Or it can be that the mutation means the way it’s changed doesn’t lead to infection in the host and it disappears. The mutation can also be what we call nonsense. It doesn’t do anything and doesn’t affect its transmission. A:Variants can happen anywhere. It’s random. That’s why it’s important to reduce transmission as fast as possible. When the virus doesn’t have enough people or hosts to infect, the probability of mutations goes down. That’s why it is very important to keep the virus at low levels. The fewer people you have unvaccinated, the greater the probability your community will be stronger and you’ll have fewer cases where the virus can infect other people. A:They’re saying that the variant from South Africa probably may not be recognized by the antibodies created by the vaccine. There are a lot of studies are going on so we don’t know exactly why that’s happening.Preliminary data indicates that antibodies to the vaccine don’t react properly with this variant. We may need to have a booster now with a new vaccine but using the genetic sequence of the variant. For Moderna and Pfizer BioNTech it is very easy to change the genetic sequence in a sequencer. (A sequencer is a scientific instrument that automates the DNA sequencing process.) It’s much faster than the traditional way. A:I wouldn’t be surprised that in future we have a mix of vaccines for different variants like we do with human papillomavirus. (Three vaccines are used to prevent most of the cancers caused by HPV.) There may be so many variants that we will need to think about mixing different vaccines that target each variant as we have with the flu vaccine.

106,"Jan 25, 2021","Anindependent reviewthat the B.C. government sat on for months identified areas that needed improving in the province’s long-term care homes’ COVID-19 response before the deadly second wave. Those included fixing gaps in infection prevention and emergency preparedness, including the use of personal protective equipment such as masks and the availability of the equipment. The review of the pandemic’s first wave, by global professional services company Ernst & Young, was finally released on Monday. It also found health authorities had differences in how they interpreted provincial orders and policies that led to differences in isolating care-home residents that tested positive for the coronavirus. The pandemic also highlighted the shortage of staffing in the long-term care system that had existed before the pandemic began. It’s still not clear the recommendations – 14 short-term and five long-term – have been fully implemented. The review said the province had already done some things well, including implementing a single-site order in the spring that prohibited care workers from working in several care homes, topping up wages of care home workers and implementing provincewide visitor restrictions. The B.C. government only released the report marked “confidential,” which was completed Oct. 22, afterPostmedia disclosedthe government ordered the review last summer, but never made it public. Initially, when questioned about the review, health ministry officials said it was “minor.” The review, which involved consultations with more than 40 groups between July and September, cost $197,000. In an interview, B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said the report should have been released when completed. Dix said he’d only seen a copy of the report in the past 10 days and noted staff, who were working “flat out,” had immediately in the fall began implementing the recommendations. “I am the minister of health. I am responsible. And it absolutely should have happened before now,” said Dix. Thereviewwas to be provided to people who had been consulted, but it was not, another mistake, said Dix. Asked if this was the complete information – and there was not a harder-hitting draft version – Dix said this was the “whole thing.” Asked whether the implementation of the recommendations meant the province had taken the necessary steps before the second wave, Dix said he believed that “many of them have been.” The review was completed just as cases and deaths began to rise again sharply in B.C. According to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, 149 care home residents died in the first seven months of the pandemic. The death toll jumped dramatically since October, with 525 deaths, more than 60 per cent of the total in B.C. At the same time it released the 28-page review, the province released an implementation summary of the recommendations. Those involved better communications, including with privately owned care homes, and better reporting and collection of data. And the Health Ministry noted that, for example, centralized purchasing and supply of protective equipment was put in place for all care homes and will remain so. The review recommended that while the single-site order is in place, the province should consider increasing staffing allocations above regular levels to help operators manage absences such as sick time and vacation without having to use overtime or casual staff. The province noted that a program meant to train new health care workers on the job launched in September 2020 will help with staffing challenges. B.C. Care Providers Association president Terry Lake said the province had already violated the spirit of the review that called for allowing seniors’ associations to provide timely feedback before the report was released to the public. “I am disappointed in the timing of the report and I don’t think these recommendations have been implemented yet,” he said. Lake said, for example, the review recommended better communications so care-home operators understand what costs are covered. But he said despite some operators being hundreds of thousands, even millions, over budget, they don’t have that understanding. SafeCare B.C. CEO Jennifer Lyle said there has been improvement in PPE supply, but there continues to be different interpretations of policies depending on the health authority – and communication and staffing continues to be a challenge. Lyle noted that staffing has been a long-term challenge. The B.C. Liberals said it was deeply concerning the report had not been released until there was pressure from the media. Equally as concerning is that Dix learned of the report just in the past 10 days, said Shirley Bond, the Liberal’s interim leader. “The lack of standardization is one of the most prominent findings of the report and those issues continue to plague the NDP’s pandemic response today, over three months since the report was submitted,” said Bond. The disclosure of the review also comes as the B.C. government is under criticism for a lack of transparency on what has been happening in long-term care homes, prompting them recently to release home-by-home coronavirus infection and death statistics. The NDP government had been particularly critical of the former Liberal government for keeping reports secret and not releasing them in a timely or complete manner. ghoekstra@postmedia.com twitter.com/gordon_hoekstra 01/25/2021 – Ernst & Yo…byThe Vancouver Sun"
107,"Jan 17, 2021","A Vancouver nanomedicine company is part of a team using new genetic technology to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. Precision NanoSystems Incorporatedis working on a vaccine in the same class the ones made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the only twoCOVID-19 vaccines approved by Health Canada. PNI’s vaccine is based on a new kind of technology called mRNA which stands for messenger ribonucleic acid. The mRNA class of vaccines carry genetic instructions to make proteins that trigger the body’s immune system. Once a body has antibodies, it can fight off a real infection when it comes in contact with SARS-CoV-2, the name of the virus that causes COVID-19. James Taylor, CEO of Precision NanoSystems, said the “revolutionary technology is having an impact not only on COVID-19 pandemic but also the treatment of other diseases. “These medicines are happening today that we really didn’t have the ability to consider, say, even five years ago,” he said in a Zoom interview. “Our company is helping to bring this revolution to bear. We’re a big part of the global community around these genetic medicines.” The federal government has invested $18.2 million in PNIto carry its vaccine candidate through pre-clinical studies and clinical trails. Ottawa has also invested another $173 million in Medicago, a Quebec-city based company which is developing a virus-like particle vaccine on a plant-based platform and building a large-scale vaccine and antibody production facility. Thefederal government has an agreement with Medicago to buy up to 76 million doses (enough for 38 million people) of its COVID-19 vaccine. PNI’s vaccine, which the company is developing with other collaborators, is still at an early, pre-clinical stage. “We aim to be in early clinical trials half way through the year and completed Phase1 (and) 2 by the end of the year,” Taylor said. While the PNI vaccine isn’t going to help Canadians this year with COVID-19, it has the capacity to help in 2021 and beyond. While natural immunity to COVID-19 may extend for up to a year, it is not known how long vaccine-immunity may last. COVID-19 could become like the flu and require regular revaccinations. As well, a locally developed vaccine means creating Canadian capacity to develop vaccines for other viral epidemics, including what epidemiologists expect to be world-wide outbreak of influenza similar to the 1918 pandemic. “I think this is an opportunity for us to develop a-made-in Canada vaccine,” Taylor said. “For us, it enables us to potentially help with COVID and have a vaccine candidate to help in the future. A big part of this is for pandemic preparedness and building the capability and capacity and knowhow in Canada.” One of the challenge of a first-generation mRNA vaccine such as Pfizer-BioNTech is that it has to be kept frozen at -60 to -80 degrees C in special freezer units. Taylor believes those kind of cold chain transportation problems will be solved in future mRNA vaccines. According to theWorld Health Organization, there are 63 COVID-19 vaccines in clinical development and 173 at the pre-clinical stage. Taylor is one of the co-founders of PNI along with Euan Ramsay, the company’s chief commercial officer. The scientific co-founders of PNI are physicist Carl Hansen and Pieter Cullis. Cullis is also board chairman and scientific adviser atAcuitas Therapeutics, the UBC biotechnology company that developed the delivery system for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. PNI, founded in 2010 as a spin-off from UBC, focuses on developing technology and expertise in genetic medicine to treat a wide range of infectious and rare diseases and cancers. What has been described as PNI’s flagship product is aNanoAssemblr Benchtop Instrument, which allows scientists to develop nanomedicines for testing. PNI employs 120 people and works with more than 160 companies around the world, about 40 to 50 of which are also developing RNA vaccines. PNI is in the process of expanding at its south Vancouver location. Taylor said what is new about mRNA medicines is that they are all fully synthetic and able to be made in relatively large amounts in the laboratory. Scientists have also discovered that mRNA can be more effective than traditional vaccines made from cell cultures because they can produce both antibodies and immune killer cells. Part of the story of the arrival of mRNA vaccines is that many of the top pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines were looking into their efficacy just before COVID-19. An article inNature, the weekly British science journal, in February of 2020 about the promise of rRNA vaccinessaid they “hold the promise to revolutionize the field by addressing current manufacturing challenges and offering novel vaccine compositions. “Within weeks, clinical batches can be generated after the available of a sequence encoding the immunogen,”it says. (Immunogen is any agent that induces an immune response.) Taylor said when COVID-19 spread around the world early in 2020, mRNA vaccines “clearly won the race for vaccines. “It is a truly amazing feat considering it was the newest of all the technologies,” he said. kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
108,,"Staff in long-term care homes across Canada are struggling to isolate elderly residents with dementia during COVID-19 outbreaks, accelerating the deadly spread of the virus, experts say. These vulnerable residents have a tendency to wander as well as a need for social connection and physical touch, leading them to enter other patients’ rooms or common areas where they could contract or transmit the virus, say doctors and advocates. “It’s a significant problem in the time of COVID-19 and long-term care,” said Laura Tamblyn Watts, CEO of CanAge, a national seniors advocacy group. “It’s also quite inhumane to be locking people up in their rooms. Older people with dementia in long-term care are not prisoners,” she added. “The good news is there are some things we can do to help support infection prevention and control while at the same time not isolating seniors exclusively in their rooms.” The novel coronavirus has taken a lethal toll on Canadians living in long-term care homes. More than 3,000 of Ontario’s over 5,000 deaths have been in these facilities, as have more than 600 of British Columbia’s roughly 1,000 fatalities. Overall in Canada, residents of these homes account for 10 per cent of total cases and 72 per cent of deaths. A woman whose grandmother died of COVID-19 in a Vancouver care home has raised the alarm about residents wandering during outbreaks. Parbs Bains said she was on a Zoom call with her sick grandmother when another resident entered the room and began hugging her and kissing her on the forehead, remaining for several minutes before a nurse arrived to usher her out. The care home, Little Mountain Place, is the site of B.C.’s deadliest outbreak in such a facility, with 41 dead. But in all long-term care homes with outbreaks in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, keeping residents with cognitive impairments isolated has been a challenge, said chief medical health officer Dr. Patricia Daly. The health authority advises staff to monitor residents who wander but not to lock them in rooms or restrain them, Daly said. Tamblyn Watts said 80 per cent of residents of long-term care homes in the country have some form of cognitive impairment such as dementia. Keeping them in one room without social engagement, exercise or daily routines has a negative effect, she said. She said more staff, not necessarily with medical training but with dementia training, are needed to compassionately intervene when they see a resident wandering and redirect them to a safe area. Ideally, there would be a separate room where residents could walk to other than their own, Tamblyn Watts added. “It does, however, mean that you need to have people on deck to be able to help with that,” she said. Quebec announced last year it would hire 10,000 patient attendants to work in care homes and train them over last summer. B.C. and Ontario have also created new jobs in care homes for people without prior experience, but much more hiring needs to be done, Tamblyn Watts said. She also said more infection control, cleaning, testing and now vaccines are needed, in order to prevent COVID-19 from getting inside care homes to begin with. Dr. Roger Wong, clinical professor and vice dean in the University of British Columbia faculty of medicine, said people with dementia need a lot of hands-on care. “Clearly, we always need more staffing,” he said. But he said there are some ways to help residents with cognitive impairments stay in their rooms, including placing a stop sign by the door or hanging a curtain over the doorway. In some secure units, seniors wear wristbands that ring an alarm when they leave, Wong said. It’s also technologically possible, though not common practice, to place GPS trackers in residents’ footwear, he said. Playing a familiar piece of music in their rooms can be comforting and help them remain in that space, Wong added. He said families could plan to speak to their loved ones virtually at times when they are more likely to get confused and wander, often in the late afternoon or evening for Alzheimer’s patients. However, it can be a challenge to ensure that residents understand the people on their screen are their loved ones, he said. Jennifer Stewart, manager of advocacy and education for the Alzheimer Society of B.C., acknowledged that virtual visits can be helpful for some and confusing for others. Patients may not be able to understand or retain the information about why they need to be separated from others or be able to follow protocols, such as frequent hand washing, she added. “I think we’re in a really tough spot,” she said. “I don’t think anyone’s found a perfect solution here.” However, Stewart said person-centred care is key: looking at each patient as a unique individual and speaking with their families about how to provide them with safety, comfort and meaning. B.C. seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie said the primary way that the virus is spreading in care homes is from staff to residents, rather than from resident to resident. Staff are in close physical contact with many different patients, she noted, and many residents are not mobile. She said, though, that immediately after a single positive case, all residents and employees should be tested and residents should be isolated. Every patient positive for COVID-19 should be kept not only in their room, but as much as possible in a certain section of the home, she said. Daly of Vancouver Coastal Health said care homes in the region do not automatically do mass testing after a single staff member tests positive. She said testing depends on the likelihood the employee transmitted the virus to others in the home as well as the timing of transmission. Mackenzie has also called for frequent, routine testing of staff, which B.C. does not do. Ontario tests staff at least every two weeks and has also deployed some pilot projects for rapid testing. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said B.C. considered whether to periodically send staff to a testing site, as is done in Ontario, but that is very “low yield” and challenging to do. As for rapid testing at care homes on a daily basis, that is “not feasible” with the tests that the province has, she said. “Our focus has been instead on making sure we have the resources to ensure staffing, particularly if an outbreak has been identified. When an outbreak is identified, testing is done,” Henry said. The seniors advocate said understaffing is “absolutely” still an issue. “I think there have been additional strains on an already strained staffing system,” Mackenzie said. She said family members can be designated essential visitors to be the eyes and ears of a loved one within the care home and flag problems for staff. Some residents don’t have family members who are able to play this role but many do, she said. Mackenzie added that even when dementia patients are isolated, they should be receiving physical touch from staff. Care providers should also use gentle persuasion and de-escalation techniques to assuage any anxieties residents are experiencing, she said. “If they’re mobile enough that they’re individually ambulating out of their room in the common areas, they’ve got some capacity. That is not a person in end-stage Alzheimer’s with no capacity to understand anything,” she pointed out. “It’s easy to throw up our hands and say we couldn’t do anything, we can’t isolate these people because they wander. That is not true of every resident or even of most residents. It might be true of some and we know how to manage that.”"
109,"Jan 12, 2021","Provincial authorities could have done more to find ways to allow for a wider range of visits to long-term care homes while still limiting the spread of COVID-19, B.C.’sSeniors Advocatesays. Isobel Mackenziesaid she believes that officials didn’t appreciate the emotional impact separation would have on both long-term care residents and family members. As well, she believes that the pandemic has revealed how much time some family members spent caring for their loved ones, which gave staff more time to focus on residents who didn’t have anyone to help them. “I think we lacked a certain amount of ingenuity, imagination, and effort around how to make these visits happen,” Mackenzie said. Mackenzie said COVID-19 visiting rules in long-term care in B.C. are the most restrictive in the country.In Ontario, for example, up to two family members can be designated as essential visitors to provide care, such as help with eating, personal grooming, and communication. After closing long-term care homes to all but essential visits last March, B.C. started to allow one designated social visitor at the end of June. In November, Mackenzie released a report which looked at visiting restrictions in long-term care and assisted living.Staying Apart to Stay Safefound that a majority of residents had a visit once a week, often of 30 minutes or less. The Ministry of Health responded to the report by clarifying what it meant by essential visits versus social visits. As of Jan. 7, the10-page overview of visitorsin long-term care and assisted living acknowledges that “not every situation can be anticipated or addressed.” It says that a “essential visit is not a social visit” and that a social visit is someone “not involved in the resident’s health-care or support needs. Facility staff will determine if a visit is essential.” Mackenzie doesn’t think the Ministry of Health is going to change the rules now that the focus is on rolling out COVID-19 vaccines and concentrating initially on workers and residents in long-term care. “It’s not as much as I hoped for because it’s not changing the basic rules in place,” she said. “It’s clarifying them.” Mackenzie said even with the current guidelines, each care home interprets them differently. In some homes, regular visits of more than once a week are allowed in residents’ rooms. Other care facilities are only allowing visits in common areas, with visitor and resident separated by Plexiglas. “It runs the gamut of those extremes,” Mackenzie said. She doesn’t think care homes are going out of their way to be difficult with residents or visitors. They are interpreting the guidelines to do what they think is right to stop the spread of an incredibly infectious virus. “I think that we should have embraced more fulsomely the idea that most residents are entitled to an essential care partner if there is a person in their life that serves that role,” she said. So far, about two-thirds of the 1,000 COVID-19 deaths in B.C. have been long-term care residents. Mackenzie said except for a few cases where residents transferred from hospital have carried SARS-CoV-2, the virus has been unwittingly brought into care homes by staff and not by visitors. Gwendolyn de Geestis a retired long-term care nurse and educator. She is concerned about the quality of life of nursing home residents during the pandemic. She said she knows of a woman in her 90s who lives in a condo where her daughter visits almost every day. The daughter wears a mask, goes directly to her mother’s unit, and doesn’t come in contact with others in the building. A designated family caregiver like that in a long-term care facility, de Geest said, has unique biographical and personal knowledge that can supplement the technical expertise and knowledge of professional caregivers. The Victoria resident said the system has become so focused on the COVID-19 numbers that the needs of the elderly have been lost. “We have to find a balance between the medical model and the social model, and the social model is dad’s quality of life,” said de Geest, who recently celebrated 50 years of nursing. “Is he going to die of depression before he dies of COVID?” kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
110,"Jan 08, 2021","Health-care workers who decline the COVID-19 vaccination will need to continue to follow strict guidelines around health checks and the use of personal protective equipment, according to the B.C. Ministry of Health. In a statement Friday, the ministry said B.C. doesn’t have mandatory immunization programs, including for the COVID-19 vaccine, but health-care workers are being “encouraged” to get it. The statement said the vaccine provides “good protection for seniors, meaning they are protected regardless of the health-care worker’s immunization.” There are 51 active outbreaks in long-term care and assisted-living facilities in B.C. as of Thursday, as well as 10 in acute care. The outbreaks involve 2,333 people, including 1,501 residents and 752 staff with active cases. Asurvey of B.C. care workersconducted in December found that 57 per cent of workers planned to get the vaccine, while 28 per cent were unsure and 15 per cent didn’t intend to get it. Conducted by SafeCare B.C., the survey was disseminated to care workers through both the B.C. Nurses’ Union and the B.C. Government Employees’ Union, and had received 1,500 replies as of Dec. 18. Respondents over age 65 were more likely to say yes to the vaccine, while those in the 24-to-34 age group were the least certain, with 20 per cent saying no and 30 per cent unsure. Survey feedback indicated this could be related to concerns about pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility. Men were more likely to say yes than women. CEO Jennifer Lyle said the results of the survey weren’t a surprise as they tend to track with what the public is feeling. “There is always going to be early adopters and those with more questions,” she said. The association, which advocates for safe working conditions for continuing-care providers, is working to get answers to people with questions on the vaccine’s safety and testing standards. “The good news is that there are answers to those questions,” said Lyle. She didn’t know what policies would need to be put in place to protect workers and residents if large numbers of care workers decline to get the vaccine, but suggested one thing that could increase safety was rapid testing. B.C. Nurses’ Union president Christine Sorensen said the union is encouraging all of its members to be vaccinated, but it doesn’t believe in mandatory vaccination. “We must respect individual choice,” she said, emphasizing the need for informed consent when administering any medication. Sorensen said education is key to helping nurses, as well as the public, feel confident giving consent. “A person who chooses not to get it now might be less reluctant in a month or a year,” she said. There will also be some nurses who won’t be vaccinated for other reasons, including pregnancy or religious reasons. “For those who cannot, we expect they’ll be able to work in other areas or be redeployed,” she said. “This is done all the time for those that can’t take the flu shot when there’s an outbreak of influenza in a facility.” Sorensen said her inbox has been inundated with letters from nurses who are concerned that they won’t be able to get the second dose of the vaccine on schedule. Waiting too long for the second dose would be contrary to instructions from the vaccine manufacturer or “off-label use,” she said. “Nurses and the general public must feel confident that science is leading the vaccine effort,” she said. “Otherwise that can lead to vaccine hesitancy.” In early December, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry strongly encouraged people in health-care settings to get the vaccine, adding, “if people are thinking of going into those settings and don’t believe in immunization, then they should look for other things to do.” On Thursday, she said the province’s immunization efforts for the next week or two will focus on “seniors and elders, and those who care for them.” Health Minister Adrian Dix said B.C.’s work in long-term care relative to other jurisdictions has been good, but “I don’t think that people going through any of these outbreaks … is really that concerned about how they’re doing in Ontario or Quebec. They are worried about their family, their loved one, their community, their care home — and so am I.” He said the “overwhelming majority” of vaccinations in B.C. so far have been for people in long-term care and those who work there. gluymes@postmedia.com twitter.com/glendaluymes CLICK HEREto report a typo.

111,"Jan 07, 2021","Wondering when you’re likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine? A new online tool developed for Canada’s vaccine rollout estimates how long you’re likely to wait for the jab. TheVaccine Queue Calculator for Canadawent live Thursday. It takes into account specific federal variables for who gets the vaccine across the country. Jasmine J. Mah developed the Canadian version of the queue calculator with Steven Wooding. Mah said the calculator is working with limited information but as more data and more vaccines are approved, the calculator will become more predictable. “The provinces are still developing their plans so we couldn’t do anything more detailed,” the Toronto native said from Los Angeles. “It will still give a general idea which is useful.” The online calculator uses federal information that prioritizes high-risk and vulnerable groups: Stage 1 includes the elderly in long-term care homes, front-line health care workers and Indigenous elders; Stage 2, other health-care workers, anyone in homeless shelters and communal living situations, and essential workers. Stage 3 is everyone else. “The calculator uses the order of these populations to determine your place in the queue,” the Vaccine Queue Calculator says. Mah crunched the numbers for herself. Like many Canadians, she’s in Stage 3 and not likely to get a jab in the upper arm until well into the summer. “I’m in line behind at least 12,217,781 Canadians who will need a COVID-19 vaccination before me … only after early July,” she said in an email. So far, Canada has approved vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Vaccines by AstraZeneca and Janssens are awaiting approval by Health Canada. The calculator produces an estimate rather than a prediction where you’re at in the queue. The Canadian Queue Calculator is part of Omni Calculator, an online website that creates calculations to help people make rational, math-based decisions about a whole range of real-world problems. Omni says it’s now making five million calculations a month. “Currently, if you want to solve a math problem, you will either use a calculator app or a spreadsheet,” Omni says. “We link the simplicity of the former with the comprehensiveness of the latter — and we aspire to become a go-to tool that solves math problems for everyone on the planet.” Omni has more than 1,500 free calculators. They include the shower cost calculator that asks for data such as average shower duration as well as water price and water used to determine a total water price.

112,"Jan 05, 2021","As many as 150,000 people, including those living in long-term care facilities and front-line workers in hospitals, are expected to be immunized against COVID-19 by February, B.C.’s provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, said Monday. Henry, speaking at the first pandemic update of 2021, said that the first groups being vaccinated include residents, staff and essential visitors to long-term care and assisted-living residences, followed by those waiting for long-term care placement. As of Monday, 25,744 people have been vaccinated in B.C. Also included are front-line health care workers providing care for COVID-19 patients and remote and isolated First Nations communities. “The focus will continue to be on long-term care and assisted living, making sure that we are protecting those who are most vulnerable in our communities, and then coverage of our front lines of acute care and immunization of our at-risk First Nations communities,” said Henry. “It is a monumental task. There are many months left to go on this. We are constrained by logistics and by how much vaccine we’re receiving but we’re optimistic.” In February and March, vaccination will expand to seniors in the community who are 80 years of age and older and Indigenous elders aged 65 and above, people who are homeless or living in shelters and people in communal living situations such as correctional facilities and adults in group homes. Once priority groups are vaccinated, the public is next in line. “Contingent on supply, our plan is to begin mass vaccination strategy based on age, descending in five year cohorts after our 80 plus priority population is completed,” she said. At the briefing, Henry also released numbers on COVID-19 cases from Dec. 31 to Jan. 4. Over four days, there were 2,211 new cases: 565, 607, 500, and 539 new cases respectively. During those four days, there were 45 deaths; total COVID-19 deaths in B.C. are now at 946. The first vaccine approved for use in Canada was by Pfizer-BioNTech on Dec. 9, 2020. The Moderna vaccine was approved Dec. 23, 2020. Both vaccines require two shots to achieve maximum protection against SARS-CoV-2. Worldwide, there are more than 150 vaccines in development. Henry said as of January 4, B.C. has received a total 54,625 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. “There has been a lot of planning and preparation required for these vaccines,” Henry said. Neither vaccine can be kept stable in a fridge. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, for example, has to be kept frozen at -80 to -60 Celsius. “There is a lot of things we’re not used to having to do when we’re handling vaccines including ultra low temperature gloves, being able to work with liquid nitrogen, (and) thermal containers which are quite heavy and how do you get them from one place to another,” she said. As well, planning requires a record system to ensure that people receive the correct second dose of whatever vaccine they received the first time. And lot numbers have to be tracked to monitor batches for safety. Henry said the federal government has contracts with five other vaccine manufacturers including AstraZeneca and Janssen. Henry said B.C. is expecting to receive 792,000 doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by March. She said it’s a big learning process setting up the systems to deliver the vaccines. She admitted there have been “bumps and delays” along the way. “The focus right now with the vaccines we know we have coming in the next few weeks are the priority populations,” she said. 70,000:long-term care residents and staff individuals across the province 13,000:residents of assisted living 2,000:seniors waiting in hospital or at home for long-term care placement 30,000:front line health care workers Dec. 31 to Jan. 1:565 new cases Jan. 1 to 2:607 Jan 2. to 3:500 Jan. 3 to 4:539 Total over four days:2,211 Deaths over four days:45 Total COVID-19 deaths:946 54,201 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in B.C. kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
113,"Dec 30, 2020","So long. Farewell. Auf Wiedersehen. Goodbye 2020! I’ll skip the adjectives. They’re all overdone. I’ll mostly even skip the bad, of which there has been so much, and get to what 2020 has taught me. I learned about the elasticity of time — how it can seem to pass both quickly and slowly with days blurring into each other. When working means never leaving home, there are no imperatives to be somewhere. With nowhere to go, one is put in mind of Downton Abbey’s dowager countess demanding to knowwhat a weekend is. Yet, Canadians are lucky. We have weather and seasons that have helped order the endless days. My expat friend, Catherine, once remarked while I was visiting her in Bali that it has no weather — or more precisely, the weather never changes. Without seasons, she said, not only do days blur into each other, so too do full years and even decades. Away from the equator, people mark memories by seasons. They write songs about them, although there seems to be a propensity in North America for those long, lazy days of summer versus the cold, dark days of winter. With little opportunity to venture from home, I’ve had nothing but time to witness my neighbourhood’s changes from daffodils through cherry blossoms and blousy magnolias then on to the gardens of summer, a final spectacular burst of unusually brilliant red maple leaves and red toadstools. Now, in the gloom of the shortest days, I’ve already seen the first budding daffodils. Weather was always a conversational stopgap in this country. It’s partly because so many Canadians’ lives depend on knowing whether summer will bring droughts or floods and whether winter will bring sea ice, ice storms, clear skies or blizzards. In these COVID-times, even urban West Coasters find their lives and conversations revolving around it. If there’s only a 30-per-cent chance of rain, let’s go for a walk. If there’s an 80-per-cent chance of sunshine, maybe we could have a socially distanced picnic and I’ll bring the glühwein. A 50-per-cent chance of rain? Sorry, I’ll be busy. The line at the grocery store will likely be shorter then. I’ve come to appreciate how weather forecasting has improved since last I paid attention. It’s precise enough that on some of those marginal days when I’ve dawdled rain arrived exactly on schedule. This year has also taught me to appreciate the people who really make the city and country function. It’s taken seeing them in PPE in the early days of the pandemic when the rest of us were working from home to realize that they are the clerks, taxi drivers, delivery people, cleaners, plumbers and electricians andnotmost of the folks so often quoted in the news. Of course, we’ve all long known that health-care workers are essential in a life-and-death way. Certainly the pandemic has underscored their worth. But personal experience in 2020 has taught that the best health-care providers perform minor miracles daily not with medicine, but kindness. Still, there’s a lot I didn’t learn this year. I still don’t know how to bake bread, knit, paint, draw or play an instrument. I haven’t written a book. I haven’t even read any books of real consequence. I’ve eschewed the challenging and disturbing for the happy endings of slight fiction and TV cooking and home renovation shows. For sanity’s sake, I mostly passed on things American up until the final days of the election that some people still can’t seem to accept is over. COVID has offered more than enough news to overwhelm me without having to take on board that country’s troubled past, present and possibly future. I’ve travelled vicariously through the words of writers telling stories from beyond North America. I’ve learned to love BBC World, not least of which for its daily reminder of what a privilege it is to live in a peaceful country. But over the year, we’ve all learned in sharp and searing detail that despite the early bravado that we’re all in this together, we are. But we’re not. So many people have died. So many are still suffering from COVID itself, from anxiety, loneliness, job loss, businesses collapsing and fears about the future even with the advent of vaccines. That suffering hasn’t been equally distributed. But COVID has also taught that saying something is impossible doesn’t mean it has to be. With unprecedented speed and by working together, researchers came up with a vaccine and right-wing governments jettisoned slavish devotion to social penury in favour of spending for the public good. For a long time, we’ve been told that poverty, homelessness, addictions, gender and racial inequality are intractable problems, impossible to solve. Well, in 2021 as the post-pandemic rebuilding begins, perhaps we’ll learn that they’re not. dbramham@postmedia.com twitter.com/bramham_daphne"
114,"Dec 28, 2020","The unholy trinity of homelessness, addiction and untreated mental illness on Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside has created a humanitarian crisis. But it also poses an economic and existential threat, with vandalism, graffiti, break-ins, open drug use and overdoses pushing it to a tipping point. Security costs are through the roof at commercial, retail and office buildings. So too are the almost-daily costs of repairing damage and cleaning up garbage and even feces from building entrances. The Downtown Eastside has gone from an interesting — albeit gritty — place to work and do business to one that is increasingly dangerous and expensive. Those considerations coupled with the fallout from COVID restrictions that has more people than ever working from home has got tenants wondering whether they want to stay, and landlords wondering whether they will be able to find retail, commercial and office tenants to fill a rising number of empty spaces. The jump in operating costs is extraordinary. In one building alone, costs have risen 3,200 per cent since 2016, according to an analysis by landlords with buildings in the Downtown Eastside. Yes, you read that right — a 33-fold increase. The significance of 2016 is that it is the year that a public health emergency was declared because of the rising number of overdose deaths. Since then, millions of dollars have been pumped into the neighbourhood for housing and harm reduction — everything from buying up single-room occupancy hotels to providing a safe supply of drugs to addicts during COVID to encourage social distancing. Yet, overdose deaths this year are on track to reach an all-time high. In November alone, deaths were up 89 per cent from a year ago. For building owners and tenants, the costs just keep rising. The quadruple-digit increase is the worst case in the analysis. It went from having no security costs in 2015 to $216,534 in 2019. Window replacement costs nearly doubled in five years. Repairs caused by graffiti, vandalism or needed for improved security more than quadrupled. For tenants, that meant rents rose to $2.91 per square foot from 39 cents. For the smallest tenant, it added an extra $3,270 a year. For the largest, it meant $55,000. Other buildings have also had substantial increases — 810 per cent in one building, for example, and 300 per cent at another — with tenants’ costs increasing from between $730 to $11,330 a year. At the same time, property taxes have also gone up. For the building with that 3,200-per-cent cost increase, taxes increased 19.4 per cent between 2016 and 2019. The building with an 800-per-cent increase? Taxes were hiked 28.5 per cent. Included in those tax increases is a 0.5-per-cent “opioid overdose surtax” that was first levied in 2017. Since then, the surtax has raised $14.28 million. Nearly two-thirds of what is collected each year pays for a three-person medic unit in police and fire centres, which in 2020 amounted to $2.43 million. This year, another $310,000 was spent on an unspecified increase in city staffing in the Downtown Eastside. As for the $890,000 spent on “micro-cleaning grants,” it is hard to fathom that the neighbourhood could look worse than it does. Almost daily, landlords hear from security guards and tenants about somebody overdosing at a building’s entrance, someone being stabbed, bitten by a pit bull, assaulted, threatened or verbally abused. They say police rarely come unless it is an emergency. Even then, one landlord said that the lone security guard held down a thief for 45 minutes before officers arrived to arrest him. It’s hard to overstate how much things have changed and how chaos has been normalized. At least one landlord that I know of requires everyone in the building to be trained to use naloxone — the drug that reverses opioid overdoses — and requires that everyone carry it with them at all times, both inside and outside the building. “I wasn’t comfortable that I would know what I was doing if I ever had to use it,” said an employee who works there. She asked that her name not be used for fear of retribution. It was a relief when the COVID work-from-home order came in March. “It’s like a war zone outside our building,” she said. “In the meeting room, you have to turn the speaker phone off because of ambulances going by so often. It was shocking.” Without a massive and more coordinated effort by all three levels of government to deal with the triad of problems, Vancouver’s core is at risk of becoming like New York City’s in the 1970s — a place abandoned by everyone except for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged who have nowhere else to go. At risk is the livability that the city boasts of, to say nothing of the hundreds of millions of dollars of public and private money invested over the past decade to revive Vancouver’s historic centre. It threatens the viability of the $400-million Woodward’s redevelopment and the $32.6-million retrofit of the former police station at 312 Main St. Beleaguered Chinatown has also never been under more pressure despite the efforts of the foundation that is attempting a physical, commercial and cultural revitalization of that century-old, iconic neighbourhood. When people are living and dying on the streets in shocking conditions in one of the world’s most affluent countries and one of its most expensive cities, it is a humanitarian crisis. But it’s also an economic one when the costs of doing something are no longer outweighed by the risks of doing nothing. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter.com/bramham_daphne"
115,"Dec 26, 2020","When the story of COVID-19 in B.C. in 2020 is told, the impact it’s had on seniors in long-term care facilities will be a defining part of the narrative. On March 10, Canada’s first recorded COVID-19 death was at theLynn Valley Care Centrein North Vancouver. Since then, there have been more than 400 deaths from COVID-19 in care facilities in B.C., representing 71 per cent of the nearly 700 COVID deaths in B.C. Almost 90 per cent of people who have died of COVID in B.C. have been over the age of 70. Isobel Mackenzie is the province’sseniors advocate. From her unique position advocating for seniors, she has seen how SARS-CoV-2 has spread through B.C.’s long-term care facilities. Her office also received many phone calls and emails from distraught members of the public during the early days of the pandemic when they weren’t able to visit their relatives because of COVID-19 restrictions. We asked Mackenzie about what’s been learned so far about from the pandemic and what she expects will happen in 2021. Q: What are the weaknesses that COVID-19 exposed in our care system for seniors? A:I think the province took fairly early and decisive action because it was known that there were these fragilities around staffing. Previously, there was a group of people that could work at different facilities and do casual work for several employers. Now they’re restricted to one employer. I think that now many operators are finding it difficult. They can get full-time staff but when someone is on vacation or ill, it is becoming more difficult to find someone to backfill. It’s also exposed weaknesses for low-income seniors. I think there’s an under-appreciation of the degree to which there’s fairly significant poverty among a group of seniors — a good 25 to 30 per cent in B.C. With COVID-19, the libraries closed, the seniors’ centres closed, and the recreation centres closed. What people didn’t realize is that seniors were using those places for internet access and nutritional needs such as lunch programs. That all dried up, certainly for the first three months, and most have not opened to the degree that they were before. To give the government credit, the province stepped up with a fairly significant addition to the seniors’ supplement, a monthly top-up of Old Age Security, of $150 a month. It hadn’t been increased since 1987. Q: Why has the number of outbreaks grown in care facilities despite all the changes made to address the spread of COVID-19? A:We have much more community transmission than we did (at the start). The virus is getting in through staff members — unwittingly. I think the other thing that’s happened is COVID fatigue has set in. We’re not hospitals. Being vigilant about wearing PPE and constantly washing your hands month after month is not something that long-term care is accustomed to doing. I think we’re doing an admirable job under the circumstances but it’s a strain, and when there’s a lot of community transmission out there, that’s what we’re seeing in long-term care homes. Q: Has there been any change to allowing only one designated family member a 30-minute weekly visit to a relative in long-term care? A:Unfortunately, that still appears to be the experience for a large number of people. My office anecdotally has heard that some have been getting more visits or allowed to visit in their loved one’s room. Until the beginning of December, it was still very restrictive. They still don’t allow social visits in the room. Families are still not experiencing, for the most part, quality visits — even with one person. Q: Are there any long-term care facilities that have done such a good job in preventing COVID-19 transmission that they could be models to follow? A:The short answer is: We don’t know. When we have the opportunity to look back on this, we’ll be able to say ‘OK, who had an outbreak? Who didn’t? What’s the same? What’s different?’ Right now, everyone is in the thick of fighting the fire and there isn’t time to look at that. Q: Is the mortality rate in long-term care facilities increasing because of COVID-19? A:Not that I’m aware of. In long-term care in any given year, about 25 per cent of residents pass away. We would normally see about 8,700 residents die. When we measure what we call excess death data, some of the people in long-term care who died of COVID may have died this year of something else. It is possible that we will not see excess death data this year in part because so many people died of something other than COVID. Q: Are there some longer-term benefits of having the health-care system for seniors adapt to COVID-19? A:I think a year from now our long-term care system still will not be perfect, but I think it will be stronger and better than before the pandemic. I do believe that. I think when we look at our vulnerable seniors in the community, I think that there will still be more that can be done. I think they will be better than they were pre-COVID. There’s been a big investment in theBetter at Homeprogram (non-medical help to keep seniors in their home), expansion of thebc211phone line, which will provide more community-based services, and the increase to low-income seniors’ supplement. I have every hope and expectation that will continue post-pandemic. Q: What will the seniors advocate’s office be looking at in 2021? A:We’ll take a look back at COVID-19 and its effects. Believe me, there will be no end of people looking back and doing an assessment of things. In the first half of the year, we’ll also be looking into elder abuse and producing an income report that looks at health-care costs paid by seniors.

116,"Dec 25, 2020","Call it a Christmas miracle. Andy Yoon, a 77-year-old Abbotsford resident, was the first long-term care resident in the Fraser Health region to receive the COVID-19 vaccination — and on Christmas Eve of all days. “Oh yeah. After the vaccine, going to see my grandson,” he said in a video shared by Fraser Health. “I was waiting for it. I was waiting. “I’m very happy, you know, get the vaccine myself.” Shortly after receiving the shot, care home staff can be seen applauding Yoon in the brief video clip. The Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19 is currently being rolled out across North America. Earlier this week, the Moderna vaccine was approved for use by Health Canada and will be distributed in the coming weeks. Long term care residents have started receiving their first doses of COVID-19 vaccine in Fraser Health. Watch here:pic.twitter.com/UWsV8mipnq Here in B.C., health care workers and long-term care home residents are in the first priority group to receive the vaccine in December, January and February. There are approximately 70,000 long-term care residents and staff. “As Dr. Henry mentioned, the vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna have provided guidance on how to safely transport the approved vaccines,” said Fraser Health spokesperson Carrie Stefanson. “This means that as deliveries increase in the coming weeks, the vaccine will increasingly be available in more location including long term care homes.” Also in the first priority group are 13,000 residents and staff at assisted living residences, 2,000 individuals awaiting a long-term care placement, 8,000 essential visitors, 30,000 health care workers providing front line care, and 25,000 residents in remote or isolated First Nations communities. From February to March, another 400,000 individuals will receive their first shot of the vaccine. Those include 260,000 seniors aged 80 and up as well as Indigenous seniors and elders aged 65 and up; 40,000 individuals who are homeless or living in shelters, correctional facilities, group homes or mental health residential care homes; 60,000 long-term home support recipients and staff; 20,000 hospital staff, community general practitioners and specialists; and 25,000 people living in First Nations communities. sip@postmedia.comtwitter.com/stephanie_ip •COVID-19: Here’s everything you need to know about the novel coronavirus •COVID-19 FAQ: What you need to know about the vaccine rollout in B.C. •COVID-19: Have you been exposed?

117,"Dec 16, 2020","On the day the first British Columbian received a vaccination against COVID-19, a poll shows that two-thirds of people in the province say they will step up and get the jab. “The question that needs to be asked is not are you going to (get the vaccine), but why wouldn’t you,” said Wesley Lewin of Maple Ridge. “My father’s dad died of polio when (my father) was just five years old, and that wasn’t that long ago,” said Lewin of the once-prevalent contagious viral infection that caused paralysis and sometimes death before a vaccine was developed. “We have to do a better job of proving how safe these (vaccines) actually are. You won’t change the mind of the nine per cent (of those who oppose the vaccine nationally), but we have to make sure those who are undecided understand the facts.” The new poll, conducted byLeger, found that 67 per cent of British Columbians intend to get the vaccine, while 14 per don’t, and 19 per cent haven’t decided. Maria Werring Morrow of Agassiz said she supports vaccination, but said there isn’t enough information about the COVID vaccine yet. “I’m not going to run out and get one right away because it’s kind of scary,” said Werring Morrow, who added that she is careful to wash her hands, social distance, wear a mask on the rare occasion she goes out, and maintains a “very small bubble.” Lewin and Werring Morrow were among a number of people who responded to Postmedia social media posts asking about their willingness to volunteer to be vaccinated. On Tuesday, Nisha Yunus, a 64-year-old residential care aide atProvidence Health Care, became the first person in B.C. to be injected with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. “I am so grateful. It feels like a dream came true. It is both a privilege and an honour to receive the first COVID-19 vaccine in British Columbia,” Yunus said a statement released by the Ministry of Health. “I have seen first-hand what COVID-19 does to families, and I am hopeful we are getting closer to finally reaching the end of this pandemic, so people can reunite safely with their loved ones and put this behind us.” B.C. received its first shipment of the vaccine on Sunday, and Yunus was the first of 4,000 workers in long-term care facilities to get the jab. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the vaccine will be available at two clinics in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health regions before immunization is expanded to 30 sites. Health officials expect about 400,000 British Columbians, less than 10 per cent of the population, will be vaccinated by March. Canada signed a contract to receive up to 168,000 doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine before the end of the year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday. Once theModernavaccine is approved by Health Canada, deliveries could begin within 48 hours, he said. “I understand the Moderna vaccine is very close to approval,” said B.C. Premier John Horgan. He said the Pfizer vaccine, which requires minus-70 degree temperatures during storage and transport, will go first to front-line workers and “Moderna and other vaccines that are easier to transport” will be administered in long-term care homes before being rolled out elsewhere. He didn’t want to predict “where and how we will be distributing vaccines in February and March,” he said. Those decisions will be made “as we see what the scarcity issue is all about, how many vaccines we have available to us, and how best to distribute those.” slazaruk@postmedia.com"
118,"Dec 09, 2020","A ‘delivery vehicle’ made with nanotechnology by a company at the University of B.C. is a key part of the vaccine approved for use in Canada against COVID-19. Acuitas Therapeuticshas developed technology to allow the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to work against SARS-CoV-2. The B.C. government has announced that long-term care residents and health-care workers will be the first to receive the vaccine next week. The vaccine comes in two doses meant to be administered three weeks apart. After the first dose, the efficacy is about 52 per cent; after the second, 95 per cent. The New York Times reportedthat the vaccine worked regardless of race, weight or age. No one experienced any serious side-effects in the trial of 43,661 people from around the world but many experienced aches and fevers. The story quoted a Pfizer analysis saying that people receiving the vaccine might have to take a day off work or rest to deal with side-effects. Acuitas Therapeuticsis located in Technology Enterprise Facility 3, a five-storey concrete building at UBC, not far from the Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre. Acuitas was founded in 2009 by Thomas Madden, the company president and CEO, and his longtime collaborator, Pieter Cullis, board chairman and scientific adviser. Madden said that it was humbling to realize that Acuitas has played a role in delivering a COVID-19 vaccine. “Since February 2020, every single person at Acuitas has dedicated themselves to the development of COVID-19 vaccines to fight this deadly and devastating virus — working nights and weekends, missing important personal events and, I can confirm, losing a lot of sleep,” he said in a news release. “(This vaccine) gives us a light at the end of what has been — on a global level — a very dark tunnel.” The delivery system made by Acuitas are lipid nanoparticles about80 nanometresin size that protect the vaccine made out of messenger RNA (mRNA) once it’s injected. Lipids are organic compounds and key parts of the structure and function of cells.Nanotechnology deviceswere originally made out of metals and ceramics but now nano devices are being made out of biomolecules such as lipids. Messenger RNA tells the body to make proteins based on the genetic blueprint provided by DNA. Acuitas compares its lipid nanoparticles to a delivery technology used to ship a fragile glass ornament to your home. Except that the package being delivered is the vaccine. “No matter how bumpy or rough the journey was, our delivery technology would make sure that the ornament was protected,”Acuitas says in a backgrounder. “Our carrier would find your house, open the front door by itself, let itself in, unwrap your glass ornament and leave it in the front hallway for you to pick up.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
119,"Dec 08, 2020","More seniors are driving later into their 80s and are increasingly deciding themselves when to stop getting behind the wheel of a vehicle, according to theOffice of the Seniors Advocate. In releasingtwo annual reportsabout supports and services for seniors in B.C. on Tuesday, Isobel Mackenzie said 74 per cent of seniors over the age of 65 still have a driver’s licence. In 2019-2020, a total of 75,300 seniors over the age of 80 were required to takedriver fitness medical exams. Beginning at 80, the exams are required every two years on the grounds that medical conditions affecting driving are more common after that age. “We saw a six-per-cent increase over the previous year of people going for the in-driver medical exam,” she said during a virtual news conference. “That reflects, to some extent, that people are driving further into their years after 80. That reflects that their health is better.” Mackenzie went on to say that there was an 18-per-cent decrease in the number of people referred for theenhanced road assessment test, an on-road driving test. “That is telling us that if a senior is no longer able to drive, they are likely deciding that on their own,” Mackenzie said. “The number of (those) people who go into a doctor’s office and walk out with their driver’s licence intact and no further testing needed is 94 per cent approximately. So that’s a good thing as well.” Both theLong Term Care Quick Facts Directoryand theMonitoring Senior Services Reportinclude data for the year ending March 31, 2020. They don’t show the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on seniors. That data will appear in next year’s reports. In her review of transportation issues, Mackenzie said for HandyDART there was a one-per-cent increase in clients and an 11-per-cent drop in ride requests. During the same period, the percentage of seniors in B.C. increased by four per cent. “This continues to be an interesting area to look at,” she said. “You’re not seeing the kinds of growth and uptick in rides and demand that you might expect to see given what’s happening in our population.” In 2019-2020, theSeniors Abuse and Information Linereceived 5,558 calls, an increase of 27 per cent compared to the previous year; but 46 per cent of those calls were about non-abuse matters. Mackenzie said thebc211 Helplinereceived 347 calls about elder abuse, a 15-per-cent decrease. “I am struck by how we don’t really have good data and good collection on elder abuse,” Mackenzie said. “My office is doing a systemic review on this issue and will be coming out with a report and recommendations in the new year.” Later, in response to a question about elder abuse, Mackenzie said not only is there a lack of awareness about the issue, people don’t know where to report it if they see it. And once it’s reported, there isn’t a coordinated way to track the data. “We need a cleaner system,” she said. “I think that will allow us to get a better handle on what degree of abuse is happening out there.” Mackenzie said many low-income seniors are struggling, in part because the B.C. Senior’s Supplement has remained at $49.30 since 1987. “As one of the provincial government’s responses  to COVID-19, recipients of the senior’s supplement received an additional $300 per month from April to December 2020,” Mackenzie said inMonitoring Seniors Services. “It is hoped this will continue past the pandemic.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

120,"Nov 29, 2020","Whether they call themselves snowbirds or winterbirds, Canadians who travel south are changing their migration pattern dramatically this winter. In a normal year, more than one million Canadians head south to the U.S., Mexico and other destinations to follow the sun. The COVID-19 pandemic is clipping their wings and forcing many to stay in Canada this winter. Of those who are travelling, some are driving west to RV parks on Vancouver Island. Canadians staying at home include Monika and Wayne Hilson. For about 12 years, the West End couple have spent January, February and March near sunny Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. But not this year. Instead of travelling and spending three months in Playa Gemelas, they’re staying close to home in Vancouver. “I’m really not one of these scaredy-cat types,” said Monika Hilson, 76. “Initially, I thought about going down.” She figured she could go out and buy groceries while her husband Wayne, who is 84 and has prostate cancer, stayed in their condo with its big deck. But her husband’s health along with other COVID-19 related concerns tipped the balance toward taking a pass this year. She said a webcam at the Puerto Vallarta pier where they often go for lunch shows waiters without masks. “You know, if people are not adhering to any social distancing, what’s the point?” said Hilson, a former flight attendant who worked through the swine flu and SARS without catching either virus. Hilson said beaches in the resort are closing at 3 p.m. and restaurants at 8 p.m. “What fun is that?” she said. Plus there’s the worry of whether someone sitting beside you on the plane has COVID-19, not to mention the masses of people that congregate at the airport. “I’ll bet my last dollar that most Americans are going to go anyway,” Hilson said. “They don’t seem to recognize the fact there’s a virus, or don’t care about it or ignore it due to the fact of their fearless leader.” She’s resigned to spending more time looking at squirrels in Stanley Park and feeding roasted pumpkin seeds to finches by Lost Lagoon. “You know what?” she said. “Yesterday was supposed to be a crappy day. I saw the sunshine and I thought, ‘Hey, how lucky we are to live on English Bay. You live beside a 1,000-acre park.’ “Hello! Am I bored? I’m not.’” TheB.C. Lodging and Campground Associationhas said that snowbirds who can’t drive to the U.S. are driving toRV parks on Vancouver Island. The association has reported that RV parks that operate at half capacity during winter have waiting lists. Evan Rachkovsky, director of research and communications for theCanadian Snowbird Association, said in a non-COVID-19 year, more than one million Canadians leave the country and head south to the sun. Snowbirds are individuals 55 years of age and older who spend 31 days or longer outside of the country each winter. “We’ve spoken with some members who are adamant that they do want to travel down south this season,” he said. “Others, and I’d say a majority, aren’t comfortable travelling in the midst of a global pandemic. They have chosen to stay home this winter season.” Of his association’s 110,000 members, about 70 per cent drive south in their own vehicles. But Rachkovsky said with the land border likely to remain closed well into 2021, it’s difficult to say how many Canadians will decide to fly to the U.S. A survey of 3,000 snowbirds bySnowbird Advisorfound that 44 per cent are not going anywhere this winter, 31 per cent said they were, and 25 per cent are undecided. The survey released Wednesday reported that 50 per cent are going to Florida, 20 per cent to Arizona, eight per cent to California and six per cent to Mexico. A total of five per cent said they were coming to B.C. which is much higher than previous years when it is less than one per cent. Rachkovsky advises anyone who decides to head south to read their out-of-province health insurance coverage carefully. CSA endorsesMedipac travel insurance planwhich is covering COVID-19, he said. “Some insurance providers are capping or putting limits on the amount of money they’re providing for COVID-related claims,” Rachkovsky said. The federal government has aglobal travel advisoryin effect which says Canadians should “avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice.” With a federal travel advisory in effect, insurance may not cover travel or health expenses. Vancouverite Camilla Grinti said she already has her ticket to Puerto Vallarta for Jan. 7. Grinti, who calls herself a winterbird, doesn’t plan to buy health insurance. She plans to stay in Mexico until the end of April. She knows she’s taking a risk. Grinti has a friend who got sick with something not related to the pandemic in Mexico. Grinti’s friend said she received excellent care in a private clinic. “I am in a lucky position,” said Grinti, 73. “If by any chance I get sick, I have money enough to pay for private clinic in Mexico. I don’t count on Canada to give me back the money.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com Get the latest COVID-19 news delivered to your inbox weeknights at 7 p.m. by subscribing to our newsletterhere."
121,"Nov 25, 2020","Don’t you have anything joyful in your life? A reader demanded to know. Too much of what you’re writing comes from the dark side, he said. Maybe you should retire. It got me thinking. … And no, not about retirement. To the question of joyful stuff, I can answer a conditional yes. They’re have been small scale things close to home in a year when, ironically, I had planned to visit Bhutan – the first place in the world where government budgets are screened through the lens of their effect on citizens’ happiness and well-being. Instead, my greatest joy was discovering on frequent neighbourhood walks this fall that those red toadstools of my childhood books aren’t fiction. But about the dark side stuff. COVID-19 has exposed gaping holes in our social safety net. The elderly, the poor, indigenous people, people of colour are all dying at higher rates than other Canadians. It’s shocking and shameful. So I make no apologies for writing about it. However, like the reader, I too have days when the news seems more than I can bear. So, to get some perspective, I sought out some happiness experts to find out how we are doing and how they’re doing. First, the personal. Lara Aknin bought a projector last summer, hooked it up to her laptop and screened movies on the garage door for her kids and others in the neighbourhood. Kids were in front with individual bags of popcorn; adults in the back, socially distanced, with their own refreshments. “Hands’ down, it was the highlight of my five-year-old’s summer,” said Aknin, a distinguished professor and associate editor of theWorld Happiness Report. Beyond that, she’s organized virtual dinner parties for her colleagues working in her lab at Simon Fraser University. For the first one, they all ordered Indian food from their favourite restaurants and hung out together. “It was so kooky and unusual. It was lots of fun,” she said. John Helliwell is happily chopping wood for the stove at his home on Hornby Island. “It’s purposeful exercise and I always find that infinitely better than exercising in the gym,” said Helliwell whose many titles include editor and co-author of the World Happiness Report, senior research fellow and UBC economic professor emeritus. “It’s part of what you find in happiness studies, generally. If you help other people and do things that have a purpose and not just things for rote reasons or for your own self-interest, you’ll be happier.” Far from feeling isolated, Helliwell has found there are now more – not fewer – opportunities to talk to friends and colleagues because nobody waits for a big, international conference to get together. Every week, many of the world’s leading researchers trying to discover the secret to well-being and life satisfaction Zoom in to seminars organized through Oxford University. Unlike most seminars though, the first 20 minutes of the hour are devoted to what Helliwell describes as “the kind of things you talk about at drinks after a meeting.” So, what about all the dismal pandemic stuff doing to us more generally? It’s true that the more you know and read about the pandemic, the more worried and fearful you become, according to the DanishHappiness Research Institute’s reportHappiness in the Midst of a Pandemic. But it also found that newspaper and magazine readers are less likely to feel that way than people who get their news from other sources, which may help explain the oblivious anti-maskers. If it bleeds, it leads. Crime sells. Those are enduring journalistic tropes. But Aknin said it hides the fact that generosity and kindness is happening en masse. She pointed to a recentYouGov pollthat found a surprising jump in people reporting acts of kindness by strangers during the pandemic. That polling and analysis by the Imperial College of London found Canadians were second only to the Danes in saying that the pandemic has brought people closer together. In contrast, the Americans are at or near the bottom in both that poll and work done byGallup. Because of greater focus on family, close friends and relationships during the pandemic, the Happiness Institute found generally people’s sense of life meaning and purpose unchanged from before. Social connectedness is far and away the best predictor of happiness. But Helliwell pointed out that it’s also bolstered by trust in government, which so far in Canada has only increased since the pandemic. Of course, it’s not all sunshine and light. In fact, parts of the Danish report are downright dismal. Extrapolating from responses from close to 12,000 people from March until late summer in 97 countries (including Canada), it says that in a population of one million people, 100 new COVID cases would lead to 2,500 people feeling less satisfied with their lives and 7,200 people becoming more anxious. Of course, happiness isn’t imposed even if many things like pandemics seem completely beyond our control. Happiness is subjective. It’s something of a choice, which is why the Danish report ends on a happy note with evidence-based recommendations for things within our control. Go outside for more than 15 minutes every day. Do arts and crafts or a do-it-yourself project (sourdough bread, anyone?). Meditate. Help someone. Keep in touch with friends. Exercise. And don’t read your email. … OK, I made that last one up. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter.com/bramham_daphne"
122,"Nov 23, 2020","Countries with strong regulation and centralized oversight of their long-term care have fared better overall in dealing with COVID-19, according to veteran, Canadian seniors care researchers. Fuelled by this, co-authors Pat Armstrong and Marcy Cohen are making recommendations to Ottawa in a discussion paper today by Vancouver-based Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a left-leaning think-tank. “It’s exactly two months from (the throne speech on September 23, which indicated there would be national standards for long-term care) and nothing has happened,” said Cohen. It comes as several provinces report record high number of daily COVID-19 cases as well as more and larger outbreaks in seniors care homes. “We’re now in our second wave (of COVID-19). It’s time to talk about what the system should look like and for the federal government to use its spending power.” Cohen sees the debate between the role of provincial and federal jurisdictions as “dysfunctional jockeying and political posturing” between the two. “The setting of clear standards in health care as a condition of federal funding is not an attack on provincial jurisdiction — it is the only path forward to a universal public system of long-term and continuing care, the same path Canada took to universal hospital and physician care.” Australia, Austria, Hungary and Slovenia are places with overarching standards and approaches to long-term care that have generally had lower numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths. There needs to be a federal plan for reducing a “dependence on for-profit facilities,” said Armstrong, a professor at York University. She added it needs to ensure “that all public money for elderly care goes to public or non-profit organizations, including subcontracted services.” Their other goals for Ottawa include “ensuring everyone has access to care based on need, without financial barriers, and with minimum waiting times for admission.” They also call for national rules on staffing levels at facilities with a minimum of 70 per cent being full-time at a single site. Infection plans should include adequate PPE as well as measuring effective laundry treatment, room size and air ventilation standards, backed by public reporting with consistent, verified data, plus enforcement of penalties for failing to comply. Cohen said some provinces like B.C. and Quebec have taken early action and already implemented parts of these recommendations such as restricting movement of staff and training many more of them. According to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control’s latest availablesituation report, adults over the age of 70 comprised nine per cent of COVID-19 cases, which is in proportion to their 13 per cent share of the general population. However, they are greatly overrepresented when it comes to accounting for 42 per cent of COVID-19 related hospitalizations and 84 per cent of deaths. Another challenge that is pressuring long-term care is risinghousing instability. Isobel Mackenzie, the B.C. seniors’ advocate, recently said issues such as rising rent, renovictions and landlord issues are pushing some of the 20 per cent of B.C. seniors who don’t own their own homes into the long-term care system as a way of avoiding homelessness. jlee-young@postmedia.com"
123,"Nov 21, 2020","Seventy-one-year-old Réal Bergeron worked his whole life, starting as a soldier with the Canadian Army, then as a diamond driller in mines and, for 20 years before his retirement, as a steelworker in a foundry. But he faced some struggles, including being forced to sell his leaky condo because of skyrocketing strata fees. As he grew older, his financial difficulties worsened. In recent years, the only affordable accommodation the pensioner could find was in Downtown Eastside shelters, including one with just a mat on the floor and a nightly curfew. It wasn’t where he thought he’d spend his retirement years. “It was disappointing, all right,” said Bergeron, a friendly man who is reluctant to complain. “For a guy like myself, I’m a widower, they should have more (affordable) housing.” He is not alone. Report after report, homeless count after homeless count has warned that people older than 55 are the fastest-growing homeless demographic in Metro Vancouver. Every year, an increasing number of seniors apply for rental assistance from the provincial government, but the supplements are not keeping pace with rent increases. And the number of seniors applying for subsidized housing far outpaces how quickly it can be built, said the B.C. seniors’ advocate. And with the large number of baby boomers who are expected to retire by 2030, the fear is that the situation will get far worse, especially when it comes to housing affordability. “Right now, 24 per cent of Vancouver’s homeless population are seniors. I think that’s a trickle. I think we’re gonna start to see a flood,” predicted Jenny Konkin ofWhole Way House, an organization that provides support to vulnerable seniors in Vancouver. “I feel really sad and shocked that there hasn’t been a plan put in place, knowing that with this baby boomer generation we’re just scraping the surface.” Konkin is part of a federally funded group that has been meeting for a year to try to find solutions. The diverse members include more than 50 representatives of non-profit housing, charities, landlords and building owners, city halls and government agencies, and seniors with lived experiences. This Seniors Housing Lab group has asked the provincial government to form a seniors’ ministry or appoint a seniors minister to oversee the patchwork of housing, health and economic services currently being delivered to seniors, arguing B.C. is one of only three provinces without such a system. Research by this group found some alarming statistics: 13.5 per cent of Metro Vancouver’s seniors live in poverty, close to 100,000 people; and between 2008 and 2020, the number of seniors experiencing homelessness increased fivefold. The2020 Metro Vancouver homeless countcounted550 people over age 55, who accounted for one-quarter of all the region’s 2,200 homeless residents.And one out of every 10 of those elders said theyfirst experienced homelessness in their senior years. Vancouver’s 2019 counthad similar results, with 23 per cent of homeless people over the age of 55. Alison Silgardo, CEO ofSeniors Services Society, is also part of the Housing Lab group. For three decades, her society has helped older people in B.C. find suitable housing. It also provides assistance with grocery shopping, medical transportation, light housekeeping and filing taxes, primarily for residents of Burnaby and New Westminster. In a typical year, the society receives 14,000 requests for aid. But in 2020, that has increased by at least one-third, or roughly an extra 4,600 pleas for help. “The numbers went up astronomically in the last eight months,” Silgardo said. “Seniors that we knew, who we worked with in the community, were being overwhelmed around mental health and were requiring assessments for suicide, and sometimes as many as twice a week, which is not something we normally saw in our 30 years.” The spike was due in part to increased isolation and some support services closing because of COVID. But Silgardo said another key reason was housing insecurity. “The biggest crisis is around just the helplessness with the loss of a home, with the rents increasing way beyond their income,” she said. “It is heartbreaking … They were working, they were independent, they have income — just the income no longer meets their cost of living.” Bergeron searched for apartments he could afford on his pension, but couldn’t find anything in Vancouver’s expensive rental market. A year ago, a shelter worker suggested he apply to live inVeterans Memorial Manor, a Downtown Eastside building that houses 133 men who have served in the military or are over the age of 55 and at risk of homelessness. He has his own bathroom and can cook in his small, subsidized room. A grateful Bergeron can afford the $490 rent. “This is excellent here. You feel safe because you have a roof over your head,” he said. “I’m happy to be alive every day, and healthy.” Konkin’s Whole Way House charity is situated inside Veterans Manor. Its staff, who are funded by B.C. Housing, organize activities that have turned the modest building into a home: “family” dinners, birthday celebrations, games and special outings. The workers also provide assistance for things like medical appointments, budgeting and transportation. “The reason seniors were becoming homeless, or slipping through the cracks, was because they weren’t receiving the support they needed to stay independently housed,” Konkin said. “There might be resources out there in the community but, often, seniors don’t know how to access them. They don’t know how to use a computer, they don’t have a cellphone.” There are seniors’ housing units in Vancouver, Konkin said, but problems emerge when tenants have declining cognitive or physical health, and no family nearby to help. Konkin is working with four other housing providers to expand her support services into their buildings. But she needs government funding, which she argues would be cheaper than these seniors ending up in hospitals or in care homes — and more humane than seeing them in shelters. “The fact that we’re allowing seniors to become homeless in Canada is shocking to me,” she said. Konkin introduced Postmedia to an 83-year-old retired drywaller who needs a walker to get around, and who moved into Veterans Manor last year after spending several months in homeless shelters because he couldn’t find an accessible accommodation that was affordable on his pension. He fell on hard times after a bad injury that left him with two pins in his leg, a concussion and his first brush with homelessness. Since COVID-19 hit in March, Konkin’s organization, in conjunction with B.C. Housing and several Vancouver restaurants, has delivered more than 100,000 meals to 600 seniors and other vulnerable residents living in 19 non-profit buildings. While handing out the meals, the Whole Way House staff ask seniors how they are doing, provide information about services, and even deliver balloons on their birthdays. “Just building this real relationship with people, letting them know that they’re not alone, we haven’t forgotten about you,” she said. The meal-delivery program is in response to the pandemic, but it’s the type of thing Konkin would like to see offered in the future to help seniors stay in their homes. Supporting seniors, she and other advocates argue, does not necessarily need a major investment by government, but rather a more efficient redistribution of the housing, health and transportation resources that already exist but are now run out of different ministries. According to research done by the Seniors Housing Lab, five provinces, including Alberta and Ontario, have seniors’ ministries, and two more provinces have junior ministers responsible for seniors. An email from Premier John Horgan’s office would not comment on whether a seniors’ ministry is being considered for the new cabinet, which will be sworn in soon. A statement from Municipal Affairs and Housing said there was a parliamentary secretary for seniors in the last government, and listed some of the commitments the NDP has made, including a $1-billion investment in care homes, expanding theinformation service bc211and theBetter at Homeservice, and more funding for rental assistance and affordable housing. The government deserves credit for opening 800 new subsidized units for seniors in 2019-20, the first time that has expanded in years, but housing can’t be constructed fast enough to keep up with demand, Isobel Mackenzie, the B.C. seniors’ advocate, said. In herlast report, she said there was a 14-per-cent increase in demand and the average wait time was 1.5 years. The government’s SAFER, or Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters, program provided rental assistance to 25,000 seniors in 2019-20, a three-per-cent increase over the previous year — and 4,300 of those, or nearly one out of every five, were new recipients. Nearly all of them — 94 per cent — are single with an average annual income less than $20,000. Mackenzie expects there are other low-income seniors who haven’t applied for SAFER but would qualify, and she noted the 25,000 recipients are a small percentage of the one million seniors in B.C. “But it’s still a lot of people. And they’re in serious trouble,” she said. “With an income of $19,632, and you’re living in Vancouver, where your average rent is $1,382 and your average SAFER grant is $207.” She has raised alarm bellsin several reportsabout housing instability among seniors, caused by factors such as renovictions, rising expenses and landlord issues, which all affect the 20 per cent of B.C. seniors who don’t own their own homes. The only option for some people facing eviction is to go into the expensive, overburdened long-term care system, even though they don’t need that much support. “There are a group of people that are being placed in long-term care because of economic reasons more than health reasons,” Mackenzie warned. She worries about the future, as more people will retire without good pensions, fewer will own their homes mortgage-free, and an increasing number will have endured asset-splitting divorces. Scott Morrison, 62, ticks those boxes: He does not have a good pension, does not own his home, and is divorced. He worked his whole life in the “helping profession,” as a Downtown Eastside outreach worker, a foster parent and with Saferide, which provides medical-related transportation to those with addiction issues. He also ran a moving company. When Morrison needed a sudden heart-valve replacement, it meant he could no longer look after foster kids and he lost that income in January. That meant he couldn’t pay the $2,700 rent on his east Vancouver house with his $1,200 monthly disability cheque, and he depleted his savings while looking for somewhere else to live From August until early November, he and his chihuahua Peanut lived in his small car, buying meals at a grocery store deli counter. “It was really hard. Thank God I have friends that would let me shower at their place,” he said. “It was very depressing, especially when it was raining.” The Seniors Support Society offered him temporary affordable housing earlier this month in a Burnaby bachelor suite. “It’s beautiful,” said the good-natured man. “It’s got everything you need. Nice and warm. My dog loves it.” But it is just for three months until Morrison finds something more permanent, and that’s not an easy task in this low-availability, high-rent market. “It’s very difficult,” he said. “There’s such a lack of affordable subsidized housing.” lculbert@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

124,"Nov 20, 2020","Cancelled in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Vancouver SunRunis returning next year as a virtual event. One of the big differences for 2021 is that registered participants will be able to customize their own 10-km course, said Tim Hopkins, race director. “It will work similar to how a Sun Run would work except people can run their own course at their own time that’s convenient to them and follows the provincial health mandate,” he said. Registration for the2021 Virtual Vancouver Sun Runopens next week. Earlier this year in March, organizers cancelled the Sun Run scheduled for Sunday, April 19. In 2019, more than 43,000 runners and walkers took part in the recreational run. It’s the largest event of its kind in the country and the third biggest timed 10-km run in North America. It was the first cancellation of The Vancouver Sun Run in 35 years. Hopkins said while there’s no doubt cancelling the event was the right thing to do, it wasn’t easy for anyone. “Having to cancel in mid-March was difficult, not only for us as organizers, but for people who were doing the training and excited to participate,” said Hopkins, the race director for 16 years. He said now that we’re at what appears to be the height of the second wave of the pandemic, organizers felt that the Sun Run wouldn’t be in a position to have a safe in-person event with more than 40,000 people next spring. “We want to follow all the provincial health mandates and be a good corporate citizen,” he said. “We felt the best route would be to launch as a virtual event.” The2021 Vancouver Sun Runwill take place from April 18 to 30. Participants can take photos of their run and submit them to The Vancouver Sun Run website and social media. In the past, all the names and times of participants were published in The Vancouver Sun on the Monday after the run. In 2021, the newspaper will publish the same information in the week following April 30 as well as the best photos submitted by runners. “We’ll select some of the fun photos that we receive and they’ll go into the paper,” he said. Harold Munro, editor-in-chief of The Vancouver Sun and The Province, described The Vancouver Sun Run as an “iconic event in the city. “A virtual version is a nice way to carry on the tradition. This is the first time people across B.C. will be able to participate in their hometowns and share photos with us without travelling to Vancouver.” Registered participants in 2021 will receive a T-shirt and, for the first time, a medal. “We’ve never done a medal in the past,” Hopkins said. “It’s something new and we’re doing it just for the virtual event next year.” When people register, they’ll be able to pick up their T-shirt and medal at a Running Room store of their choice. If they’re not comfortable with that, they can choose to have it sent by mail. “The reality is that a lot of people are looking for things to do. A virtual run is a goal to train for,” Hopkins said. “Setting a goal in January to run 10 km by April is very doable.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
125,"Nov 18, 2020","Doug Fung died of COVID-19 on Oct. 29, just weeks after a cancer diagnosis he was sure he could beat. Now his wife, Bronwyn James, is urging others to protect each other. “He would want people to know that COVID is a really serious illness, it’s not just a flu and that there are people who are immunocompromised and that your selfish act, of not wearing a mask or knowingly going out to the community if you are infected, could have devastating effects on families,” said James, 61. The couple met while riding camels on a tour in Alice Springs, Australia, in 1987. They said goodbye in the COVID-19 ward of Lion’s Gate Hospital in North Vancouver on Oct. 28. James was allowed a brief final visit — something she is deeply grateful for — but was not allowed to stay with him. The next morning at 8 a.m., a physician called to say her husband would die shortly. An hour later, the call came from a nurse: Her husband was gone. “It was devastating. The floor just went out from under me. He was gone without me there, without his children by his side,” said James. Fung, a popular science and technology teacher at Eric Hamber Secondary, was due to return to the classroom on Sept 8, but had developed neuropathy in one of his hands. On Sept. 3, a scan showed a tumour on his brain that was related to previously undiagnosed Stage 4 lung cancer. “It was quite a shock,” said James. But the couple was optimistic as Fung, 63, was a candidate for a new immunotherapy treatment with a 70 per cent success rate. “Doug was all ready for that, andwe had every reason to believe he could recover and go into remission,” said James. On October 17, Fung was given a course of radiation to shrink the tumours in his brain. The radiation caused swelling in his brain. He was admitted to Lions Gate Hospital to treat the side effects of the powerful steroid medication he had been given to treat the brain swelling. ”After 11 days in hospital he came out,” said James. “When they discharged him, he was short of breath. They assumed it was the lung cancer, and didn’t test him for COVID.” Fung couldn’t shake what felt like a bad flu. About five days later, James became ill. She went for a test and COVID was confirmed. “As soon as I knew that I had COVID, it all made sense. I knew instantly he had it.” Fung’s diagnosis was confirmed at a drive-thru test. “He tried to be brave. He said ‘I’ll beat this thing,'” said James. They can’t be sure how he contracted the virus, James said, but “when they were doing the contact tracing, we knew Doug had been in hospital for 11 days, he hadn’t been anywhere else.” She believes Fung contracted the illness in the hospital, where he was in a shared room with other patients and had close contact with many security guards because of agitation caused by his medication. “I lie in bed at night and try to imagine when was that point of contact? Was it one of the security guards? Was it the woman who was in the next bed? It drives you crazy, it really drives you crazy,” said James. Fung was being cared for by a team at home, and wasn’t immediately hospitalized. “The morning before we went into the hospital, he asked me to lie down with him on the bed,” said James. “It was out of character. I think he knew.” The couple, married 33 years, had two children, Jillian, 27 and Derek, 29. Because James and her daughter were both infected, Derek couldn’t be with them to share the loss. Nor have they been able to see friends, or have any memorial due to COVID restrictions. “It’s heartbreaking,” said James. “Really tough.” The Grade 11  and 12 teacher was a hardcore Vancouver Canucks fan who loved to garden, kept a greenhouse full of rare tropical and carnivorous plants, and was adored by his students, said James. ”Doug was looking forward to retirement so much. He loved to travel, he had a bucket list, he wanted to see the pyramids in Egypt, he wanted to see France and Italy, we were going to go to the Galápagos Islands.” Friends and colleagues have created a scholarship in Fung’s honour, said James, but there is one more thing that would be an appropriate legacy: awareness and care in the community of just how devastating the illness is. “It’s such a nasty illness. It’s such a small thing to do to wear a mask, there are so many people who are vulnerable.” dryan@postmedia.com Anyone who wishes to contribute to the Doug Fung scholarship fund can do so athttps://vsb.schoolcashonline.com/Fee/Details/1869/196/false/true Under the” Fund Destination” drop-down, select “S-Eric Hamber Scholarship”.

126,"Nov 16, 2020","HandyDART delivered more trips in 2019 with higher customer ratings, according to a new performance report released this morning. The report is the first stand-alone look at what HandyDART offers passengers with disabilities who can’t use conventional transit and it gives a generally, positive assessment in contrast to some blistering criticism from one riders’ group. Respondents to an October 2019 Ipsos telephone survey done of users of HandyDART vehicles, or the “supplemental taxis” that are dispatched when the vehicles aren’t available,rated the ease of booking a trip as 8.5 out of 10. The report indicated that 87 per cent of vehicle trips pick customers up within the promised on-time window of 15 minutes before or after the scheduled time.In terms of rating overall customer satisfaction, users gave an average score of 8.6 out of 10. The report also identified challenges, noting that of the over 350,000 cancellations, 88 per cent were initiated by customers for legitimate reasons such as feeling unwell as opposed to cancellations due to vehicle breakdowns, congestion, or poor weather. Late cancellations that are within two hours of a booked trip impact scheduling, waste travel time, and affect other customers’ experience since they “may take up space that could have been used by someone else,” said the report. The number of trips that are requested, but not booked was more alarming between five and 10 years ago. “HandyDART continues to be a service that customers can trust to receive a safe and well-assisted journey. While ridership is currently low compared to pre-pandemic levels, we’d expect HandyDART demand to continue to grow as the region’s population ages over coming years,” said TransLink spokesperson Ben Murphy. Beth McKellar was less sanguine. She’s chair of the HandyDART Riders’ Alliance, a group of “riders and allies working for better HandyDART and accessible transit service” that TransLink says it met with ahead of beginning the review. She is skeptical of the information collected and the rosy assessment it yields because “2019 was a horrendous year of trying to get them to even just hear us, never mind listening to us.” McKellar and others have long been advocating for TransLink to operate its HandyDART vehicles in-house instead of contracting out the service Her frustration with the current arrangement took on a new level with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We were rolling COVID petri-dishes in the beginning. It wasn’t until I had a damned, old-fashioned hissy-fit. We weren’t getting the vehicles cleaned except for a sweep-out every 14 days,” said McKellar.  “They had excuses up the yingyang. I’ve been riding these buggies for 21 years. And they were delivering people to these (long-term care) homes and picking up from these homes.” jlee-young@postmedia.com"
127,"Nov 09, 2020","It was a gut punch to people living in assisted living and long-term care and their families who are already all-too-aware of the body of evidence confirming that the pandemic lockdowns have made their fragile health even more precarious. Even scarce family visits became more circumscribed following Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry’s two-week order that everyone in the Lower Mainland limit social contacts to household members only and further restrict their social activities. It squelched even the faint hope engendered earlier in the week when Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie called on Henry to use “compassion and kindness to temper clinical decisions around safety.” For the sake of residents’ physical, mental and emotional well-being, Mackenzie urged a loosening of visitor restrictions. Instead, we got more. And, as an aside, can I just say WTH? Why were party buses still running up until Saturday night when people like me can’t visit our mothers, fathers, spouses or grandparents? Has a drunken jaunt into the city been more important to maintain than figuring out how to ensure a little joy in our elders’ final days by allowing family visits? Henry repeatedly says that the pandemic orders won’t last forever. But as Mackenzie darkly noted in her report,Staying Apart to Stay Safe, for many residents in assisted living and long-term care, that promised tomorrow may never come. There is no doubt that the elderly are at gravest risk from COVID-19 and have been at the epicentre of the now relentlessly rising death toll. And certainly, Henry and the B.C. government deserve credit for swift and sweeping action at the beginning of the pandemic to protect them in their residences and providing more than $100 million to ensure that care aides only work at a single facility and don’t become super-spreaders. Yet, this pandemic poses a wicked problem. Even with those measures in place, there are still 37 outbreaks in care homes, including two announced Monday at Harrison Pointe in Langley and Normanna Living in Burnaby. But anxiety and loneliness is taking another terrible, measurable toll on frail elders’ physical, mental and emotional health. Mackenzie says antipsychotic prescriptions are up seven per cent, and there is a troubling trend toward weight loss. Nearly six of every 10 residents, family members and friends surveyed by Mackenzie said their loved ones’ cognitive and emotional health has declined. Of the 15,000 surveyed, 48 per cent noticed a physical decline when they were finally able to see their loved ones when the doors opened a crack at the end of June. Overwhelmingly, the respondents placed a priority on “quality of life” over “quantity of life.” If misery loves company, it’s cold comfort to those of us bearing witness and listening with broken hearts as loved ones tell us they would rather die than carry on this way. Rachel Rose and Michelle Woods recently shared their letter to Vancouver Coastal Health with me. In it, Rose quotes her mother, Mary, a retired physician and permanent resident at Point Grey Hospital. “I have nothing. I just lay here doing nothing. I ask myself, ‘Why am I being punished like this? What did I do to deserve this?’ But I know I didn’t do anything.” Woods’ father, Barry, a retired engineer, described his declining health. “Over the last few months, his delusions have become much more frequent and scary to him as all he has to do all day is stare at the four walls in his room. He tells me, this is not living,” she wrote. “Why protect him when that is the result? He would rather live his last years with risk rather than live in the hell of his mind that has resulted from isolation.” Beyond dropping in for chats and tea, more than half of the respondents to Mackenzie’s survey said they provide physical comfort, helping out at meal times, washing hair, cutting fingernails and toenails. They cajoled the unwilling into walking and exercising. They took their loved ones on outings to medical appointments, or for a drive in the country. They were also their loved ones’ eyes, ears and voices in care homes that have long struggled to meet even the government’s minimum standards for hours of care. “Essential partners in care,” their absence has led to “shameful and egregious neglect,” according to Crying Out Loud, an advocacy group of family members based in the Comox Valley. Another B.C. group, Families for Change, has rallied at the B.C. legislature demanding more access and protesting the wide variance in how administrators enforce the visitor restrictions. It says some facilities only allow one-hour visits every three weeks, others allow 30 minutes once a week, and still others restrict visits to the outdoors or require staff to act as monitors. Maybe, as Rose and Woods suggest, willing families could take the same safety training as care aides and wear proper protective equipment. Just as Henry targeted Metro Vancouver with her weekend orders, maybe she could allow more essential family visitors into care homes in regions such as Vancouver Island with low infection rates. Short of forcing care aides to be locked in along with the residents, there is no risk-free solution. Given that, what’s urgently needed — and long past due — is a rebalancing. The frail and elderly deserve the best protection possible, but their quality of life deserves to be given at least as much consideration as the quantity. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter.com/bramham_daphne"
128,"Oct 23, 2020","British Columbians wanting a flu shot should book an appointment early and expect to wait a few weeks as demand for the vaccine has started out high this year, according to one of B.C.’s largest pharmacy chains. “Everybody’s wanting to get a flu shot,” said Shawn Sangha, B.C. pharmacy operations manager for London Drugs. “The demand is there.” Sangha said the wait for an appointment at London Drugs is about three weeks and customers can sign up online. He said the appointment system will protect staff and customers by preventing groups of people from waiting together in the stores. Plus staff need time to clean the room where the injections take place between patients. The vaccine this season protects against four strains expected to hit B.C. this flu season, which began this month and runs through to April — H151, H3N2 and two B strains, Sangha said. A high-dose vaccine, which offers the same protection against the same four strains but provides four times the amount of antigens, is provided free to residents 65 and older who are residents of long-term care or assisted living homes. Others requesting the high-dose vaccine would pay $75. “That supply (of high dose) is in high demand,” Sangha said. Shoppers Drug Mart found in its 2020 flu season survey that 57 per cent of the respondents intended to get a flu shot this season, almost double the number of previous years, spokesman Harry Godfrey said in an email. “COVID-19 may be spurring some people to take the flu more seriously,” he said. There is “increased concern around flu season so demand for vaccines is high.” However, of the 40 per cent who are not planning to get vaccinated for the flu, almost three-quarters of them say “they have made it through COVID-19, so the flu doesn’t worry them in comparison, which is a concerning attitude,” he said. Shoppers continues to allow people to walk in to a pharmacy for a shot. To reduce the risk of contracting the flu, it’s recommended that people wash their hands regularly and keep their hands from their face, cough or sneeze into their arm, not hand, promptly dispose of used tissues, stay home when ill, keep common surfaces clean and eat healthy foods and stay physically active to keep immune systems strong, according to public health officials. The vaccines won’t protect against COVID-19, Sangha said. The flu can put people at risk of getting other infections, including viral or bacterial pneumonia, which affects the lungs. The risk of complications can be life-threatening, especially for those at high risk, B.C. Health says. The province in September announced it was spending $374 million for “significantly building out the fall flu immunization campaign.” It said it was adding 450,000 doses this season, for a total of two million doses. And provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry recommended this year “more than ever” people get the flu shot, as it protects individuals and others who are vulnerable and reduces the strain on the health care system. Symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle pain, fatigue and weakness, runny nose and cough, similar to a cold but flu symptoms tend to be worse, said B.C. Health. It’s important for seniors to get the vaccine before the season starts, it said. The body needs about two weeks to build immunity after receiving the vaccine."
129,"Oct 13, 2020","The top two top medical health officers in Vancouver Coastal Health say that there’s no justification for making masks mandatory at city-owned buildings. Dr. Patricia Daly, chief medical health officer, and Dr. Mark Lysyshyn, deputy chief medical health officer, say in a letter that making non-medical masks mandatory in Vancouver “could create barriers and risks for vulnerable people, such as a lack of access to essential services and the experience of further stigmatization and marginalization if they are unable to afford or wear such items. “Given the excellent COVID-19 safety plans in place at city facilities, and the relatively low rate of COVID-19 infection in the local population, there is no justification for a mandatory non-medical mask policy in city of Vancouver facilities at this time and we strongly recommend that it not be pursued.” The letter is addressed toCoun. Sarah Kirby-Yung, who plans to introduce a motion Oct. 20to Vancouver city council to make masks mandatory inside city-owned facilities. She said now is the time to introduce a mandatory mask motion because “we’re reopening a lot of city facilities that were closed immediately after the city declared a state of emergency. As we see things like libraries coming on stream or even (people) going into city hall for services, I think it’s time to put these best practices in place.” In B.C., public health experts have encouraged using non-medical masks in public locations where people are not able to keep two metres away from people. “In the hierarchy of measures to prevent COVID transmission, non-medical mask wearing is one of the lowest, and should not replace more effective measures,” according to the letter from the two doctors. More effective measures, say public health officials, are staying home if you’re feeling unwell, limiting social contacts, especially outside your own family or close friends and co-workers, and keeping physically distanced. “City of Vancouver buildings and facilities have robust COVID-19 safety plans in place, therefore there is no need for a policy requiring use of non-medical masks,” the letter says. “Masks cannot be tolerated by everyone, including those with certain underlying medical conditions, and municipal staff are not in a position to determine who might qualify for an exemption to the policy.” Dr. Meena Dawar, Richmond public health officer,has also said she doesn’t recommend making wearing masks mandatory in city-operated buildings in Richmond. In Metro Vancouver, Delta required the public to wear masks at all city facilities on Oct. 1. Richmond is considering doing the same. TransLink made masks mandatory in late August. kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
130,"Oct 09, 2020","As the northern hemisphere moves into the first fall and winter of the COVID-19 pandemic, many mental health experts are hoping for the best but expecting the worst. They believe we’re likely to see a major increase in mental health problems caused by the personal, social, and economic impacts of the pandemic as we head into a second wave of infections. In fact, the mental health problems triggered by a viral outbreak such as COVID-19 have been described as a“parallel epidemic.” Despite the challenges, mental health experts say people can help maintain an even keel by following measures such as keeping to routines, regularly connecting with family and friends, and limiting the amount of time watching TV and social media for COVID-19 updates. In Metro Vancouver, many people have been able to deal with some of the pandemic pressures by going outside into parks and beaches during the past few months. Stanley Park, for example, has turned into a kind of open-air community centre as groups have been meeting for everything from outdoor yoga and acting classes to chamber music and bird watching. But as the weather changes, people are recognizing they won’t be able to continue meeting outdoors like they did during the height of the summer. John H. Boeris in exactly that situation. He’s the coordinator of aWest End Seniors’ Networkgroup of men who have met regularly for about five years. Before the pandemic, they had breakfast together once a month at the Denny’s at Davie and Thurlow. Most participants are 60 or older. Boer is 82. He said the group of five to 10 helps create a sense of sociality to get men “out of their little cocoons. “So many people live all by themselves,” Boer said. “This is a way to help them get out and chat.” The West End has the highest proportion of older adults living alone in Metro Vancouver. After all restaurants closed, the breakfast group turned into a picnic lunch group that met outdoors once a month in the park behind Barclay Manor. Now participants have to decide about moving back indoors. If the group returns to a restaurant, then practising two-metre physical distancing becomes a problem for Boer and other participants who are hard of hearing. “I’m probably the worst of the whole lot,” he admitted. “I often sit there and I don’t know what the discussion is about. I pretend I hear it and I give answers the best I can.” They may also try to meet atBarclay Manorwhere WESN has most of its social, educational and recreational programs. But because of high demand for meeting rooms, the group may not find any space in the manor. Anthony Kupferschmidt,WESNexecutive director, said while the network was delivering its pandemic one-on-one services such as regular check-in phone calls and shopping for groceries, it heard from seniors that they were missing group connections. “People want to stay connected and they’re taking the opportunity to do it however they can,” he said. WESN is a community group for older adults with about 950 participants, 250 volunteers, and 15 staff members. Kupferschmidt said the WESN is aware of the importance of providing a space for seniors to meet as the weather changes. “We’re trying to balance that risk of feeling socially connected without putting them at greater risk of COVID-19.” Among young people, the single biggest disruption caused by the pandemic has been isolation of being away from school, according toDr. Carla Elfers, a psychologist who provides cognitive behavioural therapy for children and teens. As a mother of a school-aged child, Elfers said it was a surprise to her to find out how much youngsters missed being in the hallways and seeing their friends. “When children couldn’t go, they had the space to realize that ‘Wow, there was a lot about school I really liked. I missed seeing people, I missed seeing my teacher,’” she said. “We often speak about how highly the connected the lives of teenagers can be through social media. It was really powerful for me that teens were craving that face-to-face contact.” For many teenagers, playing an online game with a friend became a substitute for going over to their place to hang out together. “I was finding that kids themselves were getting worried about how much time a day they were spending playing different games,” she said. Dr. Elfers, former staff psychologist at B.C. Children’s Hospital, said she’s already seeing an increased demand for mental health services. Opening schools is helping but schools and teachers can’t be expected to deliver mental health services to students. “Accessing mental health care continues to be very difficult for children and families in B.C.,” she said. For children and teenagers up to age 18, publicly funded mental health services are available through the Ministry of Children and Family Development’sChild and Youth Mental Health. While Dr. Elfers recommends to start with your family doctor for a referral, she said parents and youths can also self-refer themselves. Waiting lists can be long: It can take three months to a year, for example, to see a psychiatrist for a non-emergency reason. Some families can afford to pay privately or can use third-party insurance. But there are also waiting lists for private care which can be three to six months. AtCoast Mental Health, CEO Darrell Burnham said his organization expects a “massive increase in mental health care needs” this fall and winter. “People’s normal patterns of behaviour have been disrupted,” he said. “People who haven’t had any health issues are feeling isolated from their family, friends, and so they can fall into depression quite easily.” Coast Mental Health provides a link between hospital services and the community for people living with mental illness. CMH helps about 4,500 people annually and provides a range of housing for more than 1,300, some of whom receive 24/7 care. While CMH doesn’t yet know what the full impact of COVID-19 will be on its services, it has already reduced several of its community day programs for safety reasons. Burnham said Coast Mental Health hopes to add more capacity by developing online services through a newE-Mental Health Initiative. “When I talk to families or people dealing with mental health issues, access to help is so hard,” he said. “Maybe we can create greater access to support for all areas of mental health.” Dr. Lakshmi Yathamis head of psychiatry at the University of B.C. and regional head and program medical director of Vancouver Coastal Health and Providence Health. He was co-author of an editorial in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry on the mental health of communities during COVID-19. Yatham said the article was based on watching closely what was happening in China as well as in Italy, Spain and other countries. “The mental problems triggered by viral outbreaks have been described as a ‘parallel epidemic,’”Yatham and his co-authors wrote in the article. It went on to say that there are also likely to be a “significant post-infection neuropsychiatric” complications from COVID-19. Surveys show that between 25 per cent and 70 per cent of people are showing signs of anxiety; 25 to 50 per cent, depression; and up to 20 per cent, post traumatic stress. In a study whose results haven’t been published but that Dr. Yatham was involved with, people with a history of depression or bipolar disorder were asked about how the pandemic has affected their usual patterns. He said the study found a “very strong correlation” between those who experienced the greatest disturbance in their social routines and worsening symptoms of depression. Dr. Yatham said before the pandemic, fewer than five per cent of outpatients across the country used video or telephone health consultations. But since the shift to virtual care to protect everyone from COVID-19 transmission, rates of virtual care increased to 90 per cent in some centres in April and May. “The uptake was just astronomical,” he said. Expanding virtual care could benefit people living in rural areas who wouldn’t have to travel for hours to see a psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health care worker. He predicted that as many as 30 per cent of mental health care visits will be virtual after the pandemic. In Vancouver Coastal Health, there are about 1,200 mental health care outpatient visits a month. “No one size fits all. Clearly, Some people need to be seen in person even when the pandemic is over. But there are other people who could be managed through virtual care,” he said. “When you make online platforms more secure from a privacy perspective, no reason why we can’t offer those services to some people.” Dr. Yatham said people can alleviate anxiety symptoms by keeping to routines, exercising, and staying connected with their social network as well as following public health guidelines such as washing your hands, wearing masks, and maintaining physical distance. He also recommends watching less TV and limiting the amount of time spent on social media. “We need to know what’s happening but things are not changing every hour with COVID,” he said. kevingriffin@postmedia.com There are some online and telephone services that people in need can access.

131,"Oct 04, 2020","The leaders of both the Liberals and New Democrats focused their attention on seniors while campaigning in B.C.’s provincial election on Sunday. Both party announcements pledge to keep seniors in their homes for longer, while the Liberals also added a plan to improve long-term care homes to its election platform. While campaigning in North Vancouver, Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson announced a $7,000 annual tax credit for seniors’ at-home services and a $1-billion plan to replace and upgrade care homes. “Some people may say this can be a bit expensive, but compare with the cost of institutional care, which is much, much higher,” Wilkinson said. “Seniors deserve the option of aging in place. Seniors deserve the option of the comfort and security of their own home as they age.” The Liberal plan to upgrade and build care homes is similar to the $1.4-billion, 10-year capital plan the NDP announced Wednesday, though Wilkinson said his approach would see all seniors in private long-term care rooms over five years, not 10. Wilkinson said a Liberal government would commit $200 million in each of five years to fast track construction to ensure that every senior who wants a single room in long-term care can have one. COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care homes in B.C. have been devastating and the majority of the 238 people who have died in the provincial have been seniors. Wilkinson said it’s a tragedy that can never happen again. NDP Leader John Horgan, who campaigned in Comox, announced expanded health-care education spaces and funding for seniors’ home care, saying the former Liberal government rationed services and cut back on staff. “COVID-19 has exposed the true cost of B.C. Liberal neglect to seniors’ care,” Horgan said in a statement. Horgan said the NDP plan would involve training programs for health-care workers and would ensure health authorities have the resources they need to deliver the services. “We need to make sure though that the care providers have thetime in their day to do the work that we’re asking them to do,” he said. Other details of the plan would be unveiled in the NDP election platform, Horgan said. He said the key to the plan would be to allow seniors to stay at home, where they want to be. “That’s far more cost effective than building more bricks and mortar and putting people into buildings.” The New Democrats announced on Sunday that if re-elected, their government would pay back drivers any profits generated by the Insurance Corporation of B.C. during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accidents dropped dramatically during the pandemic and the government said earlier this year ICBC had saved millions. David Eby, the attorney general who is also responsible for the public auto insurer, said the rebate would be paid at the same time as an expected 20 per cent rate reduction in insurance next May. Green Leader Sonia Furstenau said the announcement is another cynical example of the kinds of politics going on in “B.C.” for too long. “This is again such a standard approach in elections to say, ’Look, vote for us and we’ll give you this one-time cash in your pocket deal,’” she said. “We are focused on actually looking at where we want to get to.” Furstenau campaigned in Duncan Sunday and announced a plan to support renters, saying the Green party would earmark $500 million to supplement those who are paying more than 30 per cent of their income towards rent."
132,"Sep 24, 2020","COVID-19 has exacerbated problems that have plagued the long-term care and assisted-living system in B.C. for years. Lack of capacity, underfunding, a mishmash of contracts between health authorities and facilities, and a shortfall in accountability and monitoring are just some of the problems that were outlined by experts on a panel at the Union of B.C. Municipalities convention Thursday. “I don’t think I’m being hyperbolic in saying we have a crisis in residential care, and seniors’ care more broadly, in B.C.,” said Kim McGrail, who is on the faculty of the University of B.C. Centre for Health Services and Policy Research. “It’s a crisis that the pandemic put a spotlight on, but it’s not one the pandemic created.” When the first wave of COVID-19 arrived in B.C., long-term care homes were hit hard, particularly in mid- to late April. There have been 56 outbreaks at 52 facilities (47 long-term care facilities) and of those outbreaks, 32 resulted in no deaths, 24 were contained to a single staff member, seven were contained to a single resident, four involved fewer than five people, nine involved up to 15 people, and 12 had more than 15 cases. As of Thursday evening, there were nine active outbreaks. A total of 140 residents have died, which accounts for 62 per cent of the total deaths in B.C., which is lower than the rest of Canada, on average. There have been 654 COVID-19 cases in these facilities, with 295 of them affecting residents. Those living in care facilities have had to deal with a lockdown and then limitations on visits, and the government has made changes to how the system works, such as limiting staff to a single site, that are designed to reduce the chance of staff and residents being exposed to the virus. “Conversations about the sector clearly have a more pointed edge to them now, given what we’ve seen and experienced during the pandemic, but while it is more pointed, that edge has been there for a long time,” said McGrail. “I would argue we were well overdue for a broader public conversation about what we owe each other, what kind of society we want to be and how we wish to organize our resources to support aging.” Pat Armstrong, who is with the department of sociology at York University in Toronto, has been involved in studying nursing homes in six countries for the last decade. She said while there is no single model that provides a magic or universal solution, there are common principles that can act as guidelines for coming up with strategies and standards to deliver the best possible care. “The pandemic has made the need for such strategies starkly visible and even more urgent,” she said. The guidelines include making sure there are enough staff, that staff and families are continuously educated about providing care, understanding that care as a relationship requires continuity, ensuring staff have the time, training and autonomy to be flexible and respond to individual needs, and that physical environments are well-designed and maintained. “All of the models begin with an understanding of care as a relationship and recognize the importance of knowing about the person in order to attend to individual resident needs, capacities and emotions,” Armstrong said. Terry Lake, a former B.C. health minister and the new CEO of the B.C. Care Providers Association, said he hopes to see more money put into long-term care in the province and Canada-wide. “We are not keeping pace in terms of the amount of funding that’s going forward to long-term care, so we hope that whatever government is elected four, five weeks from now that they will continue to invest in newer facilities,” he said. jensaltman@postmedia.com twitter.com/jensaltman"
133,"Sep 21, 2020","Getting a flu shot is always a good idea. But infectious diseases experts say it’s crucial this year as the northern hemisphere faces a “twindemic” — the perfect storm of the convergence of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu. It’s a scenario that could endanger an already strained health care system. “Having two circulating respiratory viruses is not a good thing. This is something we can do something about,” said Dr. Kumanan Wilson, a senior scientist in the clinical epidemiology program with The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and a professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa. If COVID-19 testing centres are already exhausted and people show up with respiratory symptoms, it will overwhelm testing capacity, he said. “From a societal perspective, we have to reduce the pressure on our health-care system.” The flu season also presents a potential drain on families and workplaces. People with any respiratory symptoms, whether they are flu or COVID-19, will have to remove themselves from school and work. The flu presents its own dangers. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, there are an average of about 12,200 hospitalizations and 3,500 deaths related to the flu every year. Based on laboratory testing, there were 42,541 cases of seasonal influenza in 2019-2020. “Everyone should get the flu vaccine this year,” Wilson said. “It’s a no-brainer.” Concern about a potential twindemic is not overblown, epidemiologist Dr. Jeff Kwong said. “Most health care workers would say we’re barely managing in a normal flu season. We’re always on the verge of collapse. If you add COVID, we’re in big trouble,”  said Kwong, a professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. “The biggest problem with how we view influenza is that there are other respiratory viruses circulating,” he said. “The flu is a whole bunch of viruses with a whole bunch of different presentations. They’re impossible to distinguish without lab tests.” If people let down their guard on measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, such as wearing masks, physical distancing and hand hygiene, there will be a twindemic, Kwong said. “If people keep having parties, we’ll have influenza. But, if you can control COVID, you can control influenza.” It is also possible, but rare, to be infected with flu and COVID-19 at the same time.A study published in June in the Journal of Medical Virologyfound that, among 1,103 patients who had been diagnosed with COVID‐19 in three hospitals in Istanbul, Turkey, six were diagnosed as also being infected with influenza. Co-infected patients have been reported in China, Germany, Iran,  Japan, Spain and the United States. In Canada, provinces and territories have ordered nearly 13.8 million doses of flu vaccine, an increase of 2.6 million over estimated demand at this time in 2019, said Maryse Durette, a spokeswoman for the Public Health Agency of Canada. A small reserve has also been created and it will be available for provinces and territories if needed. So far, so good. Last year at this time, there were concerns that the flu vaccine might not be available until early November for most people because of delays in recommendations and production. This year, flu vaccine will be made available for delivery beginning in mid-September, with most deliveries completed by the end of October, Durette said. To meet the increased demand this year, a small portion of Canada’s requirement will also be supplied in November and December. “At the present time, no supply issues are expected this year and the increased demand by provinces and territories that has occurred since orders were first placed with suppliers in February is expected to be met in full.” But getting the flu vaccine rolled out this year may produce additional challenges. Health Canada has flagged some concerns, including the availability of staff and access to PPE for those who will be administering flu shots. There are also some unknowns, including the public’s fear of exposure to COVID-19 while being immunized for flu. At the same time, there is the potential of increased demand for flu shots early in the season, something that was seen in the southern hemisphere, where the flu season starts in March. “We don’t want people congregating as they usually do in gymnasium-type programs,” Wilson said. “We need to do it differently. And well.” Among the possibilities according to Health Canada: drive-through and parking lot clinics in locations ranging from car washes, arenas, insurance inspection centres and drive-thu tents. Ottawa Public Health is still working out its flu shot strategy and is to present more detail Monday at a board of health meeting. Pharmacists, who already administer between 40 and 50 per cent of flu shots in Canada, will also be enlisted to do more. “We’re expecting increased demand. People are already making reservations,” said Shelita Dattani, director of professional affairs at the Canadian Pharmacists Association, which has already posted a fact sheet aboutwhat to expect from pharmacies this year. Pharmacists may be delivering flu shots by appointment, through dedicated hours for walk-in clients, special hours for vulnerable patients, off-site services such as home visits and clinics at community halls or temporary structures. “If there is one thing you can control this year, it’s the flu shot,” Dattani said. “It’s going to be a busy year.” For those who monitor the spread of influenza, the Australian experience of the flu season, which just ended, is a sign for hope. According to anAustralian department of health reportreleased Sept. 6, influenza and influenza-like illness activity was lower than average across all systems for this time of year. There were 21,119 cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza and 36 laboratory-confirmed deaths related to flu in Australia. The numbers dropped and remained low as the flu season went on. Many who monitor the situation, including Wilson and Kwong, believe COVID-prevention measures such as physical distancing helped to reduce the spread of flu in Australia. Meanwhile,a study published last month in the Journal of Pediatricsof almost 3,000 families found that more parents planned to vaccinate their children for flu season. The researchers asked parents who visited 17 emergency departments in Canada, Israel, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the U.S. between mid-March and the end of June about their willingness to vaccinate their children. About 54 per cent said they did, an increase of nearly 16 per cent from last year. Among those who did not vaccinate their children last year, almost 29 per cent planned to vaccinate this year. Dr. Ran Goldman, a researcher and professor of pediatrics at the University of British Columbia and the study’s lead researcher, is hoping that a minimum of 70 per cent of the population will get the flu vaccine. It’s a tall order. Having 40 per cent of the population immunized for flu in an ordinary year is considered very good, Kwong said. Only among vulnerable groups such as people over 65 and those with chronic illnesses do the numbers reach 70 per cent. As a pediatrician, Goldman says he sees parents are more open to flu shots for their children, especially after he explains to them that children may be vectors of the flu for older people, such as grandparents. If you protect children, you are protecting everyone around them, he said. “I’m hoping for a milder flu season, but you can’t trust luck,” he said. “We need to tell parents to roll up their sleeves … and the sleeves of their children.” The flu shot is not 100 per cent effective, as public health authorities have to make an educated guess about what strain will be in circulation. Given the low number of cases in 2020, it has been difficult to assess vaccine match and effectiveness, Australian authorities said. For Canada, it’s still too early to say what might happen. Another strain of flu may appear in the early spring. The flu strain in circulation in November is not necessarily the same strain in circulation in March, Wilson said. “But, if you could reduce your risk, why wouldn’t you do it? Even in a worst-case scenario, it’s still worth it.” Meanwhile, Wilson sees the roll-out of this year’s flu vaccine as practice for rolling out a COVID-19 vaccine —  when one becomes available — under physical distancing constraints. “It will help us figure out the logistics.”"
134,"Sep 15, 2020","During the COVID-19 lockdown at residential care homes, Sam Monckton knew she couldn’t visit her father Garry in person. So she visited him aurally instead. For the last days of his life, Monckton stood outside Haro Park Centre care home in the West End and played her trumpet. She knew he would recognize favourite tunes such as Blue Moon and When the Saints Go Marching In. “He loved Blue Moon,” she said. “He taught me it. We used to sing it together. I knew he’d be able to connect with that. I tried to give him a little taste of closeness with his family.” Garry Monckton died April 2 of COVID-19. Sam Monckton spoke in front of a memorial she unveiled Tuesday morning to her dad and other seniors in the West End and Coal Harbour who have died of COVID-19. Of the 219 pandemic deaths in B.C, an estimated 10 per cent have been residents of the downtown Vancouver community. The memorial is a poster at a bus shelter on the north side of the 1100-block Davie. The poster is expected to be in place for several weeks. Samantha said her dad would have been honoured to have been remembered publicly. “I’m very blessed that this opportunity has been created to honour my dad,” she said. Garry Monckton was 77 years old when he died. As a blind person, he became a physiotherapist who treated a teenage Bobby Orr when he played for the Ontario Hockey Association’s Oshawa Generals. After his wife Maggie died in 2013, Monckton moved west to Vancouver. When he died he was living with dementia in Haro Centre. Spencer Chandra Herbert, MLA for Vancouver-West End, was unable to make it to Vancouver for the unveiling because forest-fire smoke disrupted his flight from Victoria. Replacing him at the unveiling was Anthony Kupferschmidt, executive director of the West End Seniors’ Network. He said that the memorial is a way to “recognize, celebrate, remember and put the names, faces and stories to the numbers we hear daily of those lost to COVID-19. “Those lost were our friends, neighbourhoods, our parents and our grandparents,” he said. “The scale of the loss to the loved ones left behind cannot be overestimated.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

135,"Sep 11, 2020","Shona Gagnon feels “a sense of dread” going into the winter months amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A poll released Friday shows the Kelowna dog trainer may not be alone. When asked what they are anxious about in the context of COVID-19, respondents to a Leger poll conducted in early September said they were most concerned about their physical health and that of their loved ones. People who are members of a racialized group were more likely to be worried about illness than their white counterparts, but also about job and income loss and their ability to pay household expenses. When asked to rank a set of concerns and the impact they were having on their mental health, 71 per cent of respondents said the possibility of a family member becoming infected by the virus was of greatest concern, followed by social isolation and not seeing family and friends. While physical and mental health topped the list of stressors, economic impacts were close behind. Gagnon said COVID-19 has impacted “so many realms of life,” and each one takes a toll on mental health. “At first, there was the shock,” she said. “We had to recognize we were in the middle of a pandemic. Now, we’ve reached the stage where we’re living with COVID and we’re going to be living with it for a while. It’s hard to adjust to that.” Gagnon, a former social worker, developed post-traumatic stress disorder from her work in the emergency room at Kelowna General Hospital. “I’m a mental health professional with mental health issues myself, so I’ve struggled, and I’ve found a few things that help,” she said. The combination of social isolation and economic uncertainty can be potent. Gagnon, who launched a new career as a dog trainer, found routine is key. She uses a day planner to “budget” her energy and ensure she is connecting with other people. She’s also turned to her three dogs, Odie, Sprocket and Spud, to keep her active and engaged. “At my lowest point, I had to get out of bed because they rely on me. Pet ownership is powerful. It creates momentum in your day,” she said. In the Leger poll, respondents identified entertainment, such as TV, movies, music and reading, as helping them to feel better, followed by exercise, visiting family and friends and having pets. Lisa Jennings, an advocate for first responders with PTSD, encourages people who are feeling low to connect with someone, but not through text or email. “People have been buddying up and Skyping,” she said. “I encourage people to make a connection once a day. Seeing someone’s face can really help.” Other members of Jennings’ online group have taken up art, photography and meditation. Chilliwack plumber Barry Brasco Commodore said he’s remained optimistic through the pandemic by focusing on his work and “being thankful” for his job. “I spend lots of time online keeping people’s hopes up,” he said. “Some are going through anxiety. I feel my years spent learning to cope prepared me for these times.” gluymes@postmedia.com twitter.com/glendaluymes"
136,"Sep 06, 2020","Pamela Hardy will be getting her 11-year-old twins vaccinated against flu as soon as an immunization program begins but she’s worried about how public health officials will deal with any overcrowding at clinics to reduce transmission ofCOVID-19. “The main concern is accessing the vaccine and not having long lineups,” Hardy said from Coquitlam. The Public Health Agency of Canada expects higher demand for influenza vaccines amid a possible double whammy of COVID-19 and flu infections. It’s recommending provinces and territories consider alternate ways to deliver immunization programs this season. Spokeswoman Maryse Durette said the agency has ordered 13 million doses of the flu vaccine compared with 11.2 million last year. A study by University of British Columbia researchers published recently in the Journal of Pediatrics suggests the COVID-19 pandemic may be motivating more parents to get their children vaccinated for flu. It found that was the case for 54 per cent of parents, up 16 percentage points from last year, among 3,000 families surveyed in Canada, the United States, Japan, Israel, Spain and Switzerland. Hardy said she’s expecting health officials to provide early and widespread information about where flu vaccines will be available, especially because working parents who rely on high-risk grandparents for childcare will want to ensure their families are immunized. “I think they need to go across all platforms because not everyone uses Facebook, especially older generations, and not everyone uses Twitter,” said Hardy. Countries including Australia in the Southern Hemisphere have experienced lower than usual flu infections this year, likely due to COVID-19 precautions, such as mask wearing, physical distancing and higher immunization rates for flu. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization, which is part of the Public Health Agency of Canada, has recommended provinces and territories take steps to allay fears about exposure to COVID-19 for those accessing immunization for influenza. “This fall, jurisdictions should consider a wide range of strategies to deliver influenza vaccine, with the goal of reducing crowding while maintaining or increasing vaccine uptake,” the committee says in its guidelines. Alternate models include allowing pharmacists or paramedics to provide immunization in provinces or territories where legislation does not permit it. “If demand is high, potential vaccine supply limitations may affect the decision to use some alternate delivery models,” the committee says. It’s recommending multiple smaller clinics be held to avoid larger numbers of people and for health-care providers to take opportunities to immunize patients and those accompanying them during discharge from hospital, for example. It also suggests vaccines be provided during senior shopping hours at pharmacies in grocery stores or outdoors, including in drive-through clinics and parking lots as well as at living centres, such as retirement homes, shelters and group homes. British Columbia’s provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, said flu rates in the Southern Hemisphere are a “slight glimmer of hope” but they do not always reflect what happens in the Northern Hemisphere so vaccination against flu is important, especially for high-risk populations like seniors who are also vulnerable to COVID-19. “My message to people in British Columbia is we all need to do our part to stop influenza this year as well and that means getting the flu shot, even if this is the first time you’ve ever had it,” she said, adding the province is working to mount a strong campaign in an effort to increase immunization for flu. Dr. Monika Naus, medical director of the communicable diseases and immunization service at the BC Centre for Disease Control, said the province has ordered two million doses of several types of flu vaccine, up from 1.5 million doses last season. Alberta Health spokesman Tom McMillan said a record amount of vaccine has been ordered this year, up by 23 per cent from last season. “We are currently developing new policies to address physical distancing and other public health measures that may be necessary this year as a result of the pandemic,” McMillan said. Ontario’s Health Ministry has ordered an additional 300,000 doses and is exploring the purchase of more, said spokesman David Jensen. Naus said only about 60 per cent of seniors typically get vaccinated but that decreases to 50 per cent for people with chronic heart and lung disease. “Somebody with both influenza and COVID will be more ill,” Naus said, noting people with any type of respiratory sickness would be required to stay home and may have to get tested to rule out the novel coronavirus. “The overall burden on the population, on the health-care system, on testing, all of that, will be reduced if we can have more people vaccinated to prevent flu transmission.” Entire families will be encouraged to get vaccinated together, in contrast to testing for COVID-19, Naus said, adding B.C. is expected to start receiving shipments of flu vaccine in mid-September, with long-term care residents and health-care workers given priority. Unlike last year, a nasal-spray form of the flu shot will be available in Canada for children between ages two and 17, she said, adding it’s a good option for those who fear needles."
137,"Sep 05, 2020","At St. Paul’s Hospital, themicrobiology and virology labnever sleeps in its hunt for the virus that causes COVID-19. Hour after hour, day after day, week after week and now month after month, the lab repeats the same process up to 800 times a day: It receives specimens, puts them through a series of processes — administrative, scientific and robotic — and delivers a result: either positive or negative. Technically, the lab doesn’t search for SARS-CoV-2, the virus’s official name. What it’s hunting is the specific genetic material, or RNA, that makes the COVID-19 virus so infectious and dangerous. A highly trained and dedicated team of up to 15 physicians, technologists and support staff follows each specimen through the process. St. Paul’s started testing for COVID-19 on Feb. 14. A lab that was already testing for several other microbes including human immunodeficiency virus and influenza had to pivot quickly to accommodate the new virus, said Dr. Marc Romney, medical leader, medical microbiology and virology. While you might think such a high-volume lab turns each sample into a number, it’s much more personalized than that. At every step, a doctor is involved in assessing the data. “Once we receive that specimen as lab doctors, it is essentially a lab consultation,” he said. “So we oversee the whole testing process. Instead of having a patient on a bed on a ward, each specimen that comes into the lab is our patient.” On Tuesday, Romney, along with Dr. Daniel Holmes, the department head, led a team from Postmedia through the hospital’s lab to see how the process works. We were taken behind the scenes to see everything including the specimens when they arrive at the hospital and the new automated robot that can operate on its own to test for the virus’s RNA. Both doctors made sure that no one from Postmedia could see or record any patient information. In some cases, test tubes with specimens were rotated away so no identifying information could inadvertently be revealed. St. Paul’s is one of the main testing sites in the Vancouver Coastal Health region which includes Richmond, Vancouver and north to Whistler and Bella Coola. At a testing site, specimens are physically collected with a 20-cm long, flexible swab. About eight cm are inserted into the nose to make contact with a spot where the nasal passage meets the throat — the nasopharyngeal area. The two-cm flocked tip is designed to pick up as many cells that could contain the replicating virus as possible. It’s not a painful procedure, Romney said, but it is uncomfortable. After the sample is taken, the swab’s tip is placed in a test tube with a clear liquid to stabilize and protect the specimen. The top of the swab is snapped off and a yellow cap is placed on the top of the tube to seal it. At St. Paul’s, the process starts in microbiology on the second floor of the Providence wing. Microbiology traditionally tested for bacteria that causes diseases such as gonorrhea and tuberculosis but the pandemic meant taking on the administrative role of accessioning, the term for entering COVID-19 test swabs into the system. “We’ve had to blur the lines because we don’t have enough staff in virology to manage the influx of specimens,” Romney said. Each specimen has a bar code for tracking. As well as a digital footprint, each sample has a paper trail that involves scanning each requisition order. A big part of testing is keeping track of each specimen. “The volumes have gone up exponentially for us as they have for everyone else,” he said. For the next stage, the samples move to virology in a different part of St. Paul’s. Virology is in the sixth floor attic in the Burrard Building, one of the oldest parts of the hospital. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, virology tests for other viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and influenza. “For safety purposes, we had to put up walls to separate COVID testing from the rest of the testing in the lab,” Romney said. “The technologists were very concerned about acquiring infections themselves by manipulating samples.” One of the ways the rest of the hospital is protected from SARS-CoV-2 is by negative pressure, which creates an air flow from inside the lab to the outside so that air does not flow from the lab to other parts of the hospital. During our visit, doctors and technologists were studying computer screens to evaluate the meaning of red S curves of data showing the production of viral RNA. As they focused on their work, around them machines whirred, buzzed and blipped as they completed various stages of their procedures. Hunting for COVID-19 requires finding RNA from the virus which has infected human cells. Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 can’t survive on its own: It has to infect a healthy human cell before replicating and moving onto more cells. “We’re not interested in the live virus. We’re not culturing the virus,” Romney said. “Our methodology is to test for nucleic acid, RNA.” The specimens are placed in one of two streams for polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests. PCR is considered a very sensitive test with fewer than one per cent false positives. One PCR testing stream uses different machines for each of the four stages of extraction, purification, amplification and detection. Even though it’s more labour intensive and involves physically moving samples from one machine to another, the stages are still automated. The Microlab Nimbus, for example, transfers specimens from the tubes into pipettes and photographs the bar codes along the way. A MagnaPure 96 extracts and purifies samples. A Light Cycler 480 uses chemicals to copy the RNA, a process that’s been described as molecular photocopying. The second stream is almost fully automated. Tests are carried out on one complex machine, which can operate at night. The Roche COBAS 6800 — one of two in the lab — has its own ventilated room. During down time, its central chamber was filled with blue ultraviolet light, an efficient sterilizer that kills any contaminants. It’s such a big and heavy machine that the hospital had to consult with an engineering firm to make sure the floor wouldn’t collapse. It costs just under $500,000. “This is the most successful technology for COVID testing,” Romney said of machine. “This is the one everyone wants.” The lab can also do single tests for SARS-CoV-2 in under an hour. They’re more expensive and take place in cases where, for example, a doctor needs to know quickly if a patient in emergency or intensive care has been exposed to the virus. Having two different high-volume streams has turned out to be a benefit for St. Paul’s. Since the automated Roche machine is in such high demand around the world, the specialized chemicals it uses are now in short supply. “We didn’t want to be reliant on a single method in case we had a problem with supplies,” Romney said. On the Roche screen, a positive for COVID-19 shows up as light pink. “We don’t accept the machine’s result,” he said. “Even though this is an automated process, there is human intervention to make sure the run is accurate and results are meaningful.” The whole process takes less than 24 hours to evaluate a sample. “There are many, many people involved in the whole process,” Romney said. “One key message is that the testing process is relatively complicated. It is not a simple process.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com • SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the name of the virus that causes COVID-19. • COVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019, the name of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 • 120 nanometres: The diameter of the coronavirus, slightly larger than influenza virus.

138,"Aug 13, 2020","Employing intestinal bacteria could boost the effectiveness of some cancer treatment four-fold, say researchers at the University of Calgary. A lead scientist in an ongoing study said Thursday her team has made huge strides in understanding how such microbiomes supercharge the potency of immunotherapy in targeting cancer cells. “We think the impact is huge,” said Dr. Kathy McCoy of the Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases at the U of C’s Cumming School of Medicine. “With cancers (normally) susceptible to immunotherapy 20 per cent of the time, and it responds at 80 per cent, that’s a major increase in efficacy.” A series of published studies on the approach dating back to 2015 hinted strongly at the potential of combining some forms of gut bacteria with immunotherapy to treat diseases such as melanoma and colorectal cancer. But scientists weren’t able to pinpoint how it worked, said McCoy, who set about using germ-free mice as research subjects. “We’d have to identify a mechanism . . . we identified three bacteria that were in an animal model of colorectal cancer and we wondered if we could tease apart the differences in the microbiomes,” she said. Her team noted immunotherapy by itself was conspicuously ineffective. But the bacteria that worked, she said, activated a T-cell that ultimately attacks cancerous tumours, shrinking them significantly. “The three specific bacteria by themselves turn on a first switch on the T-cells within the intestine,” said McCoy. That bacteria generates a tiny molecule called inosine that interacts with the T-cells to boost the immunotherapy, which in turn eradicates cancer cells. Another bacteria, akkermansia, has also been found to be an effective tumour fighter, said the scientist, and like the other three bacteria is present in humans who have been the subject of some study. “We actually found there was an increase in bacterium in the patients responding, but the studies were too small,” said McCoy. The U of C studies using humans remain preliminary for now, with researchers seeking grants to broaden that work to focus on lung cancer and melanoma over several years, she said. “We’re going to see if we can find this metabolite in the serum, or blood, and in feces, and see if they’re working with the same mechanism,” said McCoy. And there’s a strong likelihood that approach could be applied to a much wider variety of cancers, she added. That latest work is set to be published in the magazine Science, which has highlighted earlier discoveries using gut bacteria to enhance the immune system. Efforts that have pushed the envelope on the treatment, said McCoy, are “a purely Calgary” achievement and one that should help undermine public skepticism over the effectiveness of cancer research funding that’s often led to conspiracy theories. “I don’t know what people expect — research has made amazing strides in developing cancer therapies,” she said.

139,"Jul 31, 2020","There is a reason millions of people come to Canada every year. It is exceptional, vast and varied, empty and awe-inspiring. From towering mountains to a Prairie sky that seems to envelop you, the landscape makes you feel small, insignificant. It is impossible not to appreciate one’s insignificance where there are so few fences and so many kilometres of lonely, empty roads. There is a fierce beauty on a circle route from Vancouver through Rogers Pass to Regina and home again via the Crowsnest. It’s easy enough to see where nature has triumphed. Human failure litters the landscape, from a lone tree on the Prairie planted by an optimistic homesteader to the grotesque beauty of the Frank Slide, where stripping coal from a seam upset the balance and sent 110 million tonnes of rock crashing into the tiny Alberta town in 1903, killing 90 people in Canada’s deadliest rock slide. But extraordinary human feats are also evident — not least of which are the highways and railways punched through against all odds. Without these, there would be no Canada. Yet, we have neglected them, allowed parts to fall into disrepair, whether the slow decline of passenger rail trains or the decrepit kilometres of the Trans-Canada Highway. Most British Columbians barely know their own province, let alone their country, because there is just so much of it. But in this first summer of COVID, everyone now has reasons to stick closer to home. For many like me, this may be the only window of opportunity to visit aging parents and grandparents who have been locked down for months in seniors’ residences. But with nowhere else to go, it’s also a chance for Canadians to discover why 22.1 million tourists came to our country last year. It is an often-bizarre mélange, from the spectacular natural scenery to ugly strip malls. Of course, going east means getting beyond Hope on the Trans-Canada, which even midweek in a pandemic can take hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Glaringly absent are tour buses. But glaringly present are a steady stream of vehicles hauling all manner of stuff, from boats, bikes and trailers to giant bores, pipes, logs and oil. It is the same for the two-laned B.C. stretch through the Crowsnest Pass to Lake Louise, which wasn’t as busy as other years, but was still jammed with locals taking a look. Banff was a free-for-all when we were there. Banff Avenue was closed to traffic to allow for social distancing, and the town has since mandated wearing masks outside on that street. But there are thousands of kilometres of almost empty secondary highways. You can breathe easily there. Relax. Take a cooler and a picnic basket, and know that the unseen enemy is nowhere near. There are “World’s Biggests” to be seen, from a truck in Sparwood to the teepee in Medicine Hat to a moose in Moose Jaw that defended its title last year against a Norwegian competitor by hoisting up a new, bigger rack of antlers. Then there are places like Burdett, Alta., home of the world’s first irrigation pivot. Who knew? There is surprisingly good sushi in a restaurant that shares space with a Canadian Tire gas station in Regina, food truck samosas at a Coquihalla rest stop, Taber corn bourbon and dill-flavoured vodka (yes, it’s a thing in Saskatchewan). There should be wildlife along the way — elk, deer, moose, antelope, bears, mountain goats, mountain sheep, rattlesnakes. Certainly, there are lots of warnings, but the few we saw included a deer wandering down the middle of the street in Banff and one in someone’s yard in Grand Forks. There are also plenty of gophers (although one less than before we got there). But if you’re risk averse, be forewarned: It’s a jumble out there when it comes to COVID protocols. There is no consistency in the safety precautions being taken, regardless of whether you stay in B.C. or travel east through Alberta and Saskatchewan. Across the three western provinces, some small, family-run restaurants have the highest standards, while some multinationals have cashiers behind Plexiglas but unmasked servers come to your table. Hotels all have many signs telling guests what they ought to do. But why wasn’t the person making hot breakfasts at one Wyndham-branded hotel in Alberta wearing a mask? Why was the staff at a Wyndham-branded Ramada in B.C. mask-less except for the cleaners working alone? It was a stark contrast to the Fairmont Banff Springs where everyone — guests staying there or visitors coming for a drink — had to mask up to enter. At the DoubleTree Hilton in Regina, registered guests must buzz in and are met at the door by masked staff. The restaurant is closed. There’s a barrel of disinfectant in the elevators, and disinfected rooms have paper seals on the doors. From the safety of your vehicle, you can spend hours at a time without thinking about the pandemic. It’s a blessing, but also a curse. It makes it easy to forget to put on your own mask, use sanitizer and keep your distance. It means infection rates are rising again. So, until vaccines and treatments are found, we have to do these things. It’s the only way we will be able to keep travelling for essential visits to lonely loved ones or non-essential escapes for our own sanity. dbramham@postmedia.com twitter.com/bramham_daphne CLICK HEREto report a typo.

140,"Jul 08, 2020","Time has warped. Paradoxically, during the pandemic, it seems to be going both slower and faster. The mid-March lockdown feels like an eternity ago. Yet those nearly four months have blurred into speeded up sameness, punctuated by … well, nothing. I feel off balance even before the daily death tolls that bring a guilty elation because fewer Canadians have died. But they are still dying, and every day brings a new litany of COVID-induced distress. And there is my unmitigated anger over unnecessary deaths in countries like the United States where people are too self-absorbed, too stupid or too vain to take precautions for the good of others. In the beginning, the challenge of living during a pandemic was oddly invigorating. It opened the opportunity for changing patterns, thinking differently, learning new things. How else to explain the sourdough rush? The nightly pot-banging made strangers into neighbours. There was that initial, bracing belief that we are all in this together. Of course, soon enough it became obvious that we aren’t, and that people who were at the margins before are most at risk of losing their lives, their livelihoods and their homes. I ruefully admit that I shouldn’t complain. I’m healthy, have a job and no worries about paying my bills. And I was doing okay up until recently. But now, I’m not. (Although let me hasten to add that I have no intention of becoming one of those COVIDiots who won’t wear a mask, maintain social distance, or give up on hand-washing.) Daily pandemic living is wearing me down, with all its uncertainties, micro-decisions and micro-irritations. Do I have a mask? Do I need a mask? Why isn’t he wearing a mask? Why are they hogging the sidewalk? Why is there always a line-up? And why didn’t anyone plan better so that the internet and cellphone connections don’t slow and sputter when we’re all logged on and using technology that four months ago we didn’t know existed? There’s also sadness. Every week, my neighbourhood is changing, with one more empty storefront or shuttered business. But it was heartening to see the Chai Wagon parked in the doorway of a shuttered Starbucks. The unflinching optimism of entrepreneurs is one of the many lessons to be learned from COVID in a society that often fails to fully respect what courage each venture — small or large — requires. It has added another lens to my decision-making. For my favourite restaurants and shops to survive, I have to do what I can to support them. Take-out at least once a week finally feels virtuous, not lazy. The same goes for next-day delivery of cases of Okanagan wine. Going into an actual restaurant seems luxurious beyond belief, if not for the food, then for the chance to get dressed up and hear the buzz, even in a half-filled room of strangers appropriately distanced. One thing COVID has reinforced is that many of us don’t need nearly as much as what we already have. Cocooning at home has led to a few comfort purchases, as well as a necessary replacement after the stove broke during Week Two. But that’s all. Rather than sparking joy, my pandemic cull of drawers and closets sparked the realization that I still have plenty of clothes, even with fewer places than ever to wear them. Even though I’m still hamstrung by simple decisions like whether it’s okay to have an at-home dinner with friends more cavalier about socially distancing than I am, I irrationally long to run away to some place far, far from here. It’s something I am forced to think about because my use-it-or-lose-it holidays must be taken before September. So where? And how? Europe is open. But that would require a 14-day quarantine on return, to say nothing of a plane ride. And after months of social distancing, there is nothing comfortable about sharing an armrest with a stranger and the ever-present prospect that snoring and drooling will ensue. Driving also entails dozens of macro- and micro-decisions. Where do you go when many communities have made it clear they don’t want visitors? Where do you stay? If it’s a hotel, do you take your own pillow? Do you sanitize everything, or trust that someone else has? Perversely, it’s enough to make me long for the pandemic’s early days. The rules were simple: Stay home with only socially distanced, outdoor exercise and essential trips to the grocery and pharmacy allowed. Back then, there was certainty that Dr. Bonnie Henry would say that the restrictions were only for now, not for forever. But now, there is no certainty. There is only the possibility that, for better or worse, the rules might all change tomorrow. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
141,"Jul 01, 2020","Tuesday was a good news day. Yet, the fear, anxiety and worry was evident in people’s voices as they talked about the doors to long-term care homes and seniors’ assisted living residence opening a crack after a 3½ month lockdown. A single, designated family member, properly attired in personal protective equipment, with no sign of illness and no exposure to COVID will be allowed in for scheduled and time-limited visits. Even this small opening potentially means adding 3,200 people into the cloistered centre of British Columbia’s pandemic. There have been outbreaks at 48 residences — four are ongoing — 122 residents have died, another 386 have been ill along with 229 staff. Dr. Bonnie Henry’s voice caught several times when she talked about those who have died, about the “dark and anxious days” for seniors who have died during the outbreaks and about the isolation and loneliness they’ve suffered. From the beginning, the provincial health officer said decisions about the care homes have weighed most heavily, including this one to gingerly, cautiously, carefully agree that each resident would be allowed visits from a single, designated family member, properly attired in personal protective equipment. Health Minister Adrian Dix was also emotional as he talked about this having been one of the hardest decisions he’s had to make. “It’s not enough just to keep people safe,” he said. “To the maximum extent of their freedom, it’s important that they live and they live well.” “Our members are very nervous,” said Jennifer Whiteside from the Health Employees Union. “On one hand, they absolutely see the residents’ need to have visitors, but they are very anxious about their own safety and the residents’ (safety) … I think we all appreciate that the stakes are very, very high.” Like Henry, Dix and Mike Klassen from the B.C. Care Providers Association, the care workers worry that the visitors might unwittingly carry the virus through the doors, setting off a second wave. To try to ensure that doesn’t happen, the government is providing more than $160 million to hire as many as three staff at each facility to do the scheduling, the screening, the infection prevention protocols, to monitor visitors, sanitize meeting areas and ensure that visitors are wearing their masks properly. But there was a staff shortage long before COVID. So, it may be some time for care homes to find people to fill these visitor host/scheduler/infection prevention coach positions. Klassen’s hope is that families will be patient for a bit longer as the homes find staff, train them and put all the protocols in place, which he estimates will take at least 10 days and likely more. There is an overwhelming need for caution considering that 81 per cent of the Canadians who died of COVID lived in long-term care residences. That’s the highest mortality rate of all the industrialized countries — nearly double the average of all the others with the starkest comparator being Australia where only one per cent of the COVID deaths were in care homes. So the reopening risks here are also higher when there’s clearly a systemic problem. It’s one that British Columbia had started to address before the pandemic, which is why we’ve fared better than Quebec and Ontario. All are concerned, concerned, concerned. But none more so than families who have been begging, petitioning and pleading to be able to see for themselves what toll this has taken on their loved ones. And the suffering has been great with none more affected than the 70 per cent of Canadian long-term care residents that have dementia. In Britain, dementia was a contributing factor in nearly half of its long-term care home deaths. But more troubling is the surge in deaths among residents with dementia who didn’t have the virus. Between March 7 and May 1, Britain’sOffice for National Statisticsrecorded deaths among care-home residents with dementia were more than 50 per cent higher than the five-year average. The statistical agency didn’t draw any causal links to Britain’s lockdown, which began later than British Columbia’s. But when the Alzheimer’s Society surveyed 128 British care homes, 79 per cent reported as the major causes social isolation, a reduction in essential care as family carers were denied visits and the inability of residents to understand why family members weren’t visiting. “We’re hearing that some people are ‘just giving up’ or ‘switching off’ and not eating or drinking,” the society’s policy head, Gavin Terry told The Guardian. It’s no different here. It’s a toll that Dix alluded to as he and Henry pleaded Tuesday with all British Columbians to continue to keep their bubbles small, wash their hands, stay home when they’re sick and wear masks when social distancing isn’t possible. These “small, tiny acts of kindness and generosity” as Dix described them, are the reasons that residents will soon be able to see their loved ones. But without them, there’s no question that the doors will quickly be slammed shut again. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
142,,"After months of living in isolation from their families, 32,000 residents in long-term care will soon be able to have visitors. Once facilities have a writtenCOVID-19 safety planin place, which could be as soon as a week or 10 days, designated family members and friends will be able to see their loved ones in person outside or inside, including in their rooms. To make sure that happens safely, theprovincial government is providing $160 millionin new money to hire up to 2,040 staff — the equivalent of up to three new employees for each of the province’s 680 long-term care and assisted living facilities. Dr. Bonnie Henry, the provincial health officer, said Tuesday afternoon that the responsibility of opening up facilities housing vulnerable seniors has weighed heavily on her and everyone in public health. “Of course, we’re all a little anxious because we know what can happen if we don’t get this right,” she said at a news conference. “While I know everybody is very excited and anxious to see their family or their friends, please be patient for a few more days until we ensure all the safety measures are in place.” Henry said to start, residents will be able to designate one visitorwho will be able to meet with them in a designated visiting area. No visitors will be allowed at a facility that has an outbreak of COVID-19, she said. Each facility’ssafety planwill include designated staff who will screen visitors and provide guidance on how to follow all safety protocols. All visitors will be required to bring and wear a mask. Visits will have to be booked in advance. Barbers and hairdressers will be allowed into facilities once they have completed their own WorkSafeBC safety plans. “We will be monitoring this on an ongoing basis to make sure we can expand access,” Henry said. “We start small and expand as we can.” On March 9, the first COVID-19 death in B.C. was a resident of the Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver. Shortly after, visits were restricted to all long-term care and assisted living facilities in B.C. Some restrictions on “essential visits” were eased during Phase 2 of B.C.’s reopening plan, but were mostly related to end-of-life situations and providing help with feeding and mobility. As of Monday, 386 residents and 229 staff in long-term care have tested positive for the virus. They account for 21 per cent of the2,904 who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that leads to COVID-19. Since the pandemic began, 174 have died in B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix announced new funding to allow the province’s long-term care and assisted living facilities to hire enough employees to schedule and manage visits as well as ensure safety protocols are followed. He also announced another $26.5 million to cover the added costs of screening, sick time, delivering meals and other COVID-19 safety measures that long-term care and assisted living facilities have had to implement between March 30 and June 1. “This discussion of how to manage visits is among the most difficult decisions … I’ve ever been involved with,” Dix said. “It affects my family personally. It affects tens of thousands of families across B.C. As a result of decisions today, because there are 32,000 people in long-term care, there will be 32,000 more potential visitors.” Mike Klassen, acting CEO of B.C. Care Providers Association which represents about 350 organizations including private and non-government long-term care and assisted living facilities, said “for the most part it is a good day for B.C. seniors and their family members. “We have seen this lockdown for nearly four months now and we know it has been very difficult for residents and their family members,” he said. “We are pleased that Dr. Henry and Minister Dix have listened to care providers and to our recommendations that are going to be slowly implemented in coming weeks and hopefully will give relief to family members.” Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s seniors advocate who monitors and analyzes seniors’ issues and services, said the new visiting plan was thoughtful and comprehensive. “If having a better plan took two or three weeks longer, we’re better served to have a better plan because we now have something that can serve us for the next year,” Mackenzie said. “For me, what is most important is that it has allowed for indoor visits.” She believes visitors will be especially careful and follow all the safety protocols to protect their loved ones. “I have faith that they will be very responsible and that we’ll be able to open up to more than one visitor,” she said. kevingriffin@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

143,"Jun 30, 2020","Francisco Covelli is 71 years old with Alzheimer’s and his health has rapidly declined since his long-term care home was locked down in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He’s lost 4.2 kilos and become combative. Last week, his care team told his wife, Cleo, that they plan to have him committed to a mental health facility for seniors with complex mental health needs and addictions. She is adamantly opposed. She believes that if she were allowed to resume her twice-daily visits, the transfer would not be necessary. The Covellis’ situation raises questions about how people with dementia were being cared for even before COVID and how they might be treated after. Diagnosed nearly a decade ago, Francisco owned a hairstyling shop on Commercial Drive and led an active life. But the disease slowly took hold and in December 2018 Francisco moved into The Residence in Mission, a care home operated by Fraser Health. Initially, Cleo visited three times a day. After a year, she scaled it back to twice a day because of the toll it was taking on her. Cleo helped her husband with the most basic of things — communication. As his disease has progressed, Francisco has reverted to speaking his first language, Italian. But even in Italian, she said it’s often difficult to understand what he is saying. Since he’s been at The Residence, she’d always been there at mealtimes. She showered him, cut his toenails and his hair, cajoled him into taking his medication when he refused it from care aides. She also took him for drives and, withfrequent visits from their daughter and grandchildren, Francisco was doing OK. “He had contact, love and attention,” Cleo told me. “Then the lockdown came.” In mid-March the provincial medical health officer advised long-term care facilities to restrict entry to essential visits only. Cleo’s pleas to be deemed an essential visitor have been rejected by the care team. For privacy reasons, Fraser Health refused to comment on the Covellis’ plight other than to say that the decision is up to the care team. But spokesperson Dixon Tam said that because there are still active COVID outbreaks at long-term care homes, visits remain restricted to “one visitor at a time for residents/tenants who are actively dying,” although exceptions can be made by care teams. The measures, Tam said, were not taken lightly and are necessary to protect residents, staff and families and “to maintain our care system capacity.” He said Fraser Health recognizes the impact it’s having on individuals and their families, but staff are doing what they can to facilitate phone calls, Zoom and FaceTime connections. But during the first week of the lockdown, Cleo said she was unable to get through on the telephone to find out how Francisco was doing, let alone talk to him. A few weeks later when staff helped them to FaceTime, Cleo said, “He was just crying, crying, crying and couldn’t understand why I wasn’t coming in.” Then, in mid-June, Cleo was allowed to visit on four consecutive days. She showered Francisco, gave him a haircut, trimmed his nails. Throughout, her husband was calm and happy. But after four days, Cleo was told she couldn’t come back and that Francisco is now on a waiting list for a bed at Oceanside in White Rock, an hour’s drive from Mission. It’s a 24-unit mental health facility for seniors with “a documented history of failure to be managed in secondary and primary mental health community services” including people with addictions. Under B.C.’s Mental Health Act, neither Francisco or Cleo need to agree to the transfer. It can be done with a physician’s recommendation and, once Francisco is at Oceanside, its medical staff will make all decisions regarding his care. “British Columbia has unusual mental health legislation. The law allows for involuntary committals to get around the lack of services,” said Krista James, national director of the Canadian Centre for Elder Law. “His wife is right to question whether he should be moved.” James said Cleo could get a lawyer and demand access to her husband, arguing that as Francisco’s substitute decision-maker she needs to be able to see him and discuss the options with him before the transfer. Alternatively, James said, “If she (Cleo) really feels her husband isgetting good enough care, she may want to have that conversation (with staff) about ‘How can I support you to keep him here. It worked before, so why not now?’ She’d probably be willing to go in daily and help with that care.” But that would mean declared an essential visitor. Reading from Dr. Bonnie Henry’sguidance letterthat defines that as “visits considered paramount to resident care and well being, such as assistance with feeding or mobility,” James said it’s clear that Cleo should qualify especially since Francisco is no longer speaking English. Familiarity and connectivity are key to people with dementia being able to make sense of the world around them, according to Barbara Lindsay of the B.C. Alzheimers Society. Research also indicates that aggression is a common outcome if they don’t feel safe, are in pain or have unmet needs. That suggests that moving someone with dementia — especially one where they’re more likely to be medicated and restrained — should be a last resort after every other option has been exhausted. Last July, Elspeth McAuley faced a similar situation at The Residence when her 77-year-old husband, Bill, who has Parkinson’s was going to be transferred to Oceanside. Elspeth refused and the care team relented and he’s still there. But like Francisco, Bill has lost weight and is much more confused since the lockdown. At a Nanaimo dementia facility — Eden Gardens — three families have contacted me in the last month to suggest that the isolation caused by the visitor’s  ban has resulted in their loved ones losing weight, losing heart and falling. One broke her pelvis. Despite that, their pleas to be essential visitors have been rejected. Why are chronically short-staffed, long-term care homes — both publicly and privately operated — so narrowly defining “essential visits” when residents are clearly suffering? James said they shouldn’t be. “Long-term care homes aren’t emergency rooms, they’re people’s homes. We just can’t treat those places the same way or we are keeping people in jail.” Beyond that, she and Lindsay both said people with dementia or their substitute decision-makers do have legal rights. Those are outlined in the Alzheimer Society’sCharter of Rights for people with dementia,which Lindsay describes as “an aspirational document” that promotes the idea that even with dementia, the people need to be at the centre of and the focus of every decision made about their care. “I see my husband’s place of residence as a dementia jail,” Elspeth McAuley said. “So, does he, having said that he will probably spend the rest of his life looking out through the glass.” In a caring society, it shouldn’t be too much to ask that the essential humanity of our most vulnerable is respected. But we’re light years away from that. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne The Alzheimer Society of B.C.’sFirst Link Dementia Helplinefor caregivers, people living with dementia, health care providers and anyone seeking advice or information about dementia.

144,"Jun 28, 2020","In a Downtown Eastside community garden, a group of grandmother gardeners love their vegetables — and the vegetables love them right back. For two growing seasons, more than a dozen older women from the Vancouver neighbourhood have been growing bok choy, watercress, tomatoes and other vegetables in raised beds on a plot of land at the corner of Jackson and East Hastings. While the garden started out in part to provide fresh produce for seniors living in a neighbourhood where more than half the grocery stores have closed in recent years, it blossomed into something more. Women who started out as strangers became friends as they shared stories and got to know each other by gardening, weeding, harvesting and cooking. Their camaraderie has been recorded in a podcast calledRoots and Seeds. For 2020, the physical distancing requirements of the novel coronavirus pandemic meant the urban farmers couldn’t sow heritage seeds in the garden as they intended, said Kathleen Flaherty, podcast co-writer with Kathy Feng. But Flaherty is hopeful the women may be able to start planting by August. “A lot of these plants have a short growing season,” she said. “I have a little bit of optimism about that.” The garden is planted by the women inUrban Farming Poh-Pohs(poh-poh means grandmother or elderly woman in Cantonese). In the podcast, the poh-pohs talk mostly in Cantonese and Mandarin which is translated. They recount the challenge of not being able to speak English when they first arrived in Canada. But most aren’t complainers, said narrator Kathy Feng. They have become philosophical over time about adjusting to a new life in Vancouver. Being part of the gardening grandmothers is important to them, said one poh-poh. “If you have any things that make you unhappy or that you struggle with, find someone to talk about it and it will be reduced,” she said. “Especially now since I joined the garden, it’s much better.” They also cite how much they like growing vegetables. One grandmother pointed out that since she grew up in the countryside, she learned how to grow vegetables as a youngster. Yu Li, speaking in English, said she liked gardening and growing vegetables because of the flowers that she used to bring into her parents’ house. “The flowers they have life. You love them, they love you,” she said and burst into laughter. The other gardening poh-pohs include Wai Yu Chan, Hui Qing Chen, Ya Qin Wan, Rui Lian Xian, Hui Juan Xie, Yu Rong Li, Yu Ying Guan, and Ai Xia Zhang. One of the gardeners cited how important it was to provide fresh vegetables to seniors living on fixed incomes. “The seniors in Chinatown don’t have much money so I don’t have much fresh food,” she said. “A lot of the food seniors get at the food bank is not fresh and sometimes expired. At the garden, I get fresh vegetables.” When vegetables are ready to harvest, the seniors meet and divide the bounty equally. Sometimes, narrator Feng said, they sell vegetables at the farmer’s market or get together to make dumplings. One woman said they can meet friends while gardening “and learn to communicate with each other. For example, Mrs. Quan, she’s from the south and I’m from the north, the distance is so far. Now we are friends and can communicate. Friendship is very important as seniors — so we don’t get lonely.” The poh-pohs are eminently practical. “If we don’t have the garden, then we’d just be on our phones or TV and we wouldn’t even get exercise.” They also value their gardening friends highly. “This experience of everyone communicating with each other and caring for each other is very hard to come by,” said one of the women. “So I cherish it.” As the narrator said to end the podcast: “It starts with a simple act of planting a few seeds but the harvest is friendship and community.” The gardening project is a collaboration between theCarnegie Seniors Program, led by Doris Chow, and theDTES Neighbourhood House Seniors Program, led by Simin Sun. The Roots and Seeds podcast, with interviews by Veronique West, is available in English, Mandarin and Cantonese.

145,"Jun 19, 2020","George K. Ilsley| Arsenal Pulp Press (Vancouver) $19.95, 220 pp We are never, despite our best efforts, ready for death. When the death is that of a parent and the family is, like so many, weighed down with unfinished business, things unsaid and unforgiven hurts, death is even harder to face. The roaring silence of things unsaid haunts many families, but when a member of the family is a writer, the unresolved fights and complaints can become more than private tragedy. They can become the raw material for a memoir, essay, novel or short story. And if the writer can successfully transform family grief into artful prose, you get an elegant accomplishment like George K. Ilsley’s new memoir The Home Stretch: A Father, A Son And All the Things They Never Talk About. Ilsley, born in Nova Scotia and the author of the intriguing experimental novel ManBug in 2006 and the short story collection Random Acts of Hatred (2003), now lives in Vancouver. In 2010 he was the writer in residence at the Berton House Writer’s Retreat in Dawson City. He has published his stories in magazines and anthologies and in 2014 his memoir of his mother’s death, Bingo and Black Ice, won subTerrain Magazine’s Lush Triumphant award for creative non-fiction. Ilsley is a highly competent, if not dazzling prose stylist and he crafts his story about the last years of his father’s life with the same care and polish he brings to all his published pieces. After his mother’s death, and as his father’s slow decline brought the author closer and closer to being an orphan, Ilsley made regular visits home to Nova Scotia. The Home Stretch is his account of those visits and the thoughts about elder care and end of life issues the visits inspired. Give Ilsley points for honesty. His portrait of his father — stubborn, irascible and in the end bewildered by his losses — is searingly honest and moving. And the author does not spare himself in this exercise in family realism. Every moment of ego attachment, spleen or panic is portrayed with painful accuracy. No one emerges from The Home Stretch as a hero, but all the characters in this drama of small-town loss and bafflement are shown with compassion in all their human complexity. At a time when so many of us are dealing with mortality during the pandemic, this book will provide thoughtful comfort and artful relief to many readers. Tom Sandborn lives and writes in Vancouver.

146,"Jun 17, 2020","If you believe the advertising, assisted living is resort living with gourmet chef-prepared meals and with all vestiges of drudge work removed, freeing seniors to “Live Life to the Fullest!” That’s certainly not the reality with COVID-19. Outbreaks have been reported in at least four assisted-living facilities and most residents in the more than 7,600 units within those residences in B.C. are as tightly locked down as people in long-term care homes, with no outside visitors and residents not allowed to take non-essential trips out. Dining rooms have been closed. Residents’ meals are delivered to their suites. Residents are restricted to gathering in small groups only, whether in hallways or designated shared areas. Even before the pandemic, the reality wasn’t always as advertised. Assisted living has morphed from independence to de facto long-term care, a report released today suggests. But it points out crucial differences. Assisted living is subject to fewer regulations than long-term care. It’s deemed a home with hospitality services, not a care home. The underlying philosophies are that its residents have the right to choose to “live at risk” and the right to age in place. It’s an increasingly dodgy premise. A recent study found that a quarter of all residents have some form of dementia within a year of moving into assisted living. The premise fails to account for changing health circumstances of residents. Based on interviews with 28 care aides, licensed practical nurses, managers, residents and families,a report released todaysaid assisted-living facilities also suffer some of the terrible conditions that have been reported in long-term care homes during COVID-19. The staff surveyed said managers interpret ‘live at risk’ as non-interference and have discouraged them from providing needed help. The result is residents sitting for days in soiled diapers and dirty clothes. Residents not eating. Untreated infections. Frequent falls followed by trips to emergency and hospitalization. Replacing ‘living at risk’ philosophy with “relational care” where care aides, nurses and physicians can advocate for residents’ needs is one key recommendation in the report commissioned by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, the Health Employees Union and the B.C. Health Coalition. The neglect traces back to the fee-for-service model. Nearly half of all residents pay the full cost of meals, accommodation and weekly housekeeping. The others pay 70 per cent of their after-tax income with the province subsidizing the remainder. But unlike in long-term care, everything beyond the basics costs extra. Having someone do personal laundry can cost as much as $25 a load. Help with medication, bathing, dressing, night checks, meals delivered to residents who are ill, and so on all costs extra. Some residents are unwilling to pay. Others are unable. “LPNs and care aides reported residents using towels as adult diapers or for wound care, skipping meals not included in basic food packages, or wearing dirty clothing because laundry detergent was too expensive or residents could not afford to buy new clothes,” the report says. There’s a public cost as well. Karen-Marie Elah Perry, the report’s author, says assisted-living residents fall more frequently and go to hospital more often than people in long-term care homes. They also stay longer in hospital because if they can’t walk, they can’t safely return to assisted living. She urges the B.C. seniors advocate, Isobel Mackenzie, to do a review to determine “the extent of the mismatch between the care needs of residents” and “the cost to other parts of the health system due to the underfunding of publicly subsidized assisted living services and the overreliance on private-pay providers.” She also makes a strong case for increased government regulation, increased oversight including annual inspections, and better-trained and better-paid staff. (Better pay would go some way to permanently ending the practise of care aides working at several sites, which was the primary cause of COVID-19’s spread to long-term care homes.) In the nearly two decades since B.C. followed Alberta’s lead and started licensing independent or assisted living residences, much has changed. Then, it was considered housing restricted to providing each resident with no more than two non-medical support services. But the ratio of publicly subsidized long-term care beds to people aged 75 and older shrank, with a 32-per-cent decline between 2001 and 2016. It meant those needing more care had fewer places to go. They were among the so-called ‘bed blockers’ in acute care in hospital, stuck in there waiting. So, the B.C. Liberals relaxed the restrictions on assisted-living facilities in 2007, allowing for more services to be provided to each resident as they aged in place. In December, the NDP government removed all the limitations, so assisted living residences can now provide and charge for everything including dementia and palliative care. Back in 2012, the B.C. ombudsperson described the first changes as a “concerning shift in practice” and raised the alarm that the government was failing to protect residents “with a higher level of oversight.” No one paid attention then. So thank COVID-19, that this time, it’s going to be harder for the government to let the problems fester. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter.com/bramham_daphne"
147,"Jun 15, 2020","“I’m really in bad shape. I can’t talk to anyone,” Suzanne Brodie told her daughter last week. “I’m all alone.” Brodie’s daughters, Taryn and Dallas, hadn’t seen their 88-year-old mother since the mid-March lockdown of her assisted living residence to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Now, she’s in Vancouver General Hospital. Brodie was admitted May 25 and since then, aside from fraught phone calls, they’ve only been allowed one 45-minute visit each. Their mother was found lying on the shower floor in her suite at a Kerrisdale assisted living residence. She’d suffered a heart attack, several small strokes and seizures. For the first few days, she was restrained in bed or in a wheelchair. Active until then, Brodie didn’t realize that she now needs help to get from bed to chair. Like thousands of others in Canada, the Brodies can’t understand why it’s taking so long to lift the restrictions on family visits to care homes and hospitals when restaurants, hair salons and stores are reopening. Not yet is what the provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, said last week. “In the coming weeks,” was as specific as she would be. There’s no doubt the risk is high. Canada has proportionally the most deaths for long-term care residents in the world at 85 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths. And while the outbreaks are coming under control, another new one in a care home was reported June 10, bringing the total to 38 facilities that have been affected. But the restrictions are causing immeasurable anguish — and even harm — to patients and residents. During their brief visits, Suzanne Brodie’s daughters washed her hair and tried to ease the itchiness of a rash on their mother’s back. “I’m perceived as the enemy,” Taryn told me. “Locking out next of kin is no way to treat the sick and the elderly. It’s not a way to healthy outcomes for anybody.” Essential visits are allowed. But even Henry’s amended guidelines from late May aren’t definitive, leaving it open to interpretation by some unspecified someones. Vancouver Coastal tells families to read the B.C. Centre for Disease Control’s website and tells them that final approval is given by “facilities and licensing staff.” Island Health says on its website that administrators make the decision, but it can be reviewed by the Patient Quality Office. https://www.islandhealth.ca/sites/default/files/covid-19/documents/essential-visitor-policy-may-212020.pdf Essential visits include critical illness, palliative care and medical assistance in dying. But so, too, are visits “paramount to the patient/client’s physical care and mental well-being.” The “paramount” category includes — but is not limited to — assistance with feeding, mobility, personal care, communication with persons who have hearing, visual, speech, cognitive, intellectual or memory impairment, emotional and other assistance for those with disabilities as well as pediatric care and births. Jeanette Harper and Carmen Barclay were doing some of those things almost every day since their loved ones moved into Nanaimo’s Eden Gardens dementia care home. Barclay went daily at supper time to see her husband. Since the lockdown, he’s become anxious and aggressive and had to be medicated. It’s taken weeks to get the dosage right. But he’s now back to being able to hold a conversation. “He wants to see me, have me hold his hand, look him in the eye and tell him I love him and everything will be OK,” Carmen told me. “My suggestion is they look at a family member as a part of the residents care plan and acknowledge that mental health is as important as physical health.” Harper or her sister visited their 89-year-old mother, Marguerite Bell, every day to help with daily basics like dressing, brushing teeth, combing her hair and eating. Harper worries that when they do finally see her, she won’t recognize them because their mother can no longer initiate or answer phone calls without help. FaceTime calls confuse and upset her. Although families can’t visit, Eden Gardens CEO Erin Beaudoin emailed families earlier this month: “(We) are thinking to reintroduce some key volunteers to spend some time with the residents. “They are no replacement to all of you but are a little something more we can offer the elders safely at this time.” Harper was livid and contacted Island Health whose long-term care director, Tim Orr, responded by saying that Eden Gardens had misunderstood the directive. But to be fair, theBCCDC’s websitedoes say “existing registered volunteers” can qualify as essential visitors. Still, Harper said, “It’s demeaning for the director to assume that we (family members) don’t understand how COVID spreads. … If families are told not to hug and maintain social distance, we would.” Families I’ve spoken to are eager to do whatever is necessary to see loved ones — suit up in full personal protective equipment, buy and wear their own gloves and masks, continue to strictly limit their own contacts. Just give them the rules. We’re told care homes and hospitals are desperate for extra hands. Families could provide those as well as eyes on what’s happening, following a horrific report last month from the armed forces about conditions it found in Ontario care homes. The National Hockey League has a plan that Henry has approved. Yet we’ve heard nothing about plans from the care-home industry and hospitals. These restrictions aren’t forever, Henry has told British Columbians. Just for now. But the days tick cruelly by. There’s no expectation of widely available vaccine for at least two years. And, coincidentally, that’s pretty close to the average time British Columbians spend in long-term care. For seniors, the lockdown restriction should not be their forever. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
148,,"It was a disaster even before COVID-19 came along and blew open a window into Canada’s failing long-term care system, revealing to all what too many residents, families and experts have warned of for years. The neglect and conditions at some are so horrific that one person I’ve talked to described it as reminiscent of Romanian orphanages in the 1980s and 1990s under Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu. A week ago, the military was again sent into an Ontario care home owned by Sienna Senior Living, one of the largest private providers of publicly funded care in Canada. A few days earlier, the province had replaced the administrators after 22 residents died from COVID-19, and 102 residents and 40 staff tested positive. This followed last month’s deployment of Canadian Armed Forces to more than two dozen care homes in Ontario and Quebec to provide “humanitarian relief and medical support” for residents. Some had been left for days in soiled diapers, according to Brig.-Gen. C.J.J. Mialkowski’s report on what was witnessed in five Ontario homes. Others had bleeding fungal infections. Staff were aggressive and abusive. Residents were sedated “when they are likely just sad or depressed.” There were insect infestations, rotting food. The list goes on and on and prompted Ontario’s ombudsman to launch an investigation into whether the province’s oversight is “adequate to ensure the safety of residents and staff.” Nothing quite like that has happened in B.C. since the pandemic was declared … at least, not yet. It doesn’t mean it won’t happen, although it’s fair to say that B.C.’s reckoning began long before COVID. In 2014, it was the first province to appoint a seniors advocate, and she has been warning of problems ever since. In 2017, in the largest Canadian survey of residents and families, Isobel Mackenzie found nearly two-thirds didn’t get showers or baths as often as they would like. One in four residents said they never, rarely or only sometimes got help going to the toilet when they need it. They were likely downplaying the problem because 82 per cent of family members complained about their loved ones’ inability to have baths and showers when needed. Staff shortages are at the root of the problem. So too are the lack of government oversight, enforcement and penalties for failure to meet standards. Experts suggest a minimum of 4.1 hours of care per resident each day is needed. In B.C., care homes have struggled to meet a target of 3.36 hours, while other provinces such as Saskatchewan have no targets. While targets don’t guarantee good care, staff shortages inevitably hurt vulnerable residents who either can’t complain or won’t because they are afraid of reprisal. The epicentre of B.C.’s pandemic was the Lynn Valley Care Centre, where the two-month outbreak began March 7. Twenty residents died, 52 were infected and survived, along with 26 staff. Twelve days earlier, Interior Health Authority appointed an administrator after Retirement Concepts’ home to 112 residents in Summerland didn’t meet the minimum provincial standards. Last fall, three other Retirement Concepts residences in Comox, Nanaimo and Victoria were taken over by Vancouver Island Health Authority after complaints about “significant” staff shortages and their inability to meet minimum standards. Their administrators remain in place. Retirement Concepts is B.C.’s largest contracted provider of long-term care with 1,641 beds, a third of those now being run by appointed administrators. Operated by West Coast Seniors Housing under the name of Pacific Reach Seniors Housing Management, Retirement Concepts itself is a subsidiary of Anbang Insurance Group, a company owned by the Chinese government. Anbang’s purchase of the Vancouver-based Retirement Concepts was approved by the federal Liberal government in February 2017. A year later, the Chinese government took control of Anbang after its chairman Wu Xiaohui had been arrested and accused of fraud. Staff shortages have been described as epidemic at care homes because of a complicated stew of factors: Ever-increasing demand as the Canadian population ages, increased complexity of care, low wages, and the fact that many workers are hired only part-time and have no sick benefits. To pay the rent, that means that many worker have jobs at multiple sites and, often enough, don’t stay home unless they are really sick. That is what helped the coronavirus spread so quickly. And it’s why on April 1 with COVID outbreaks at 19 B.C. care homes — it would eventually spread to 37, with four outbreaks still active — B.C.’s provincial health officer issued a six-month order. The nearly 9,000 workers with jobs at multiple sites had to choose a single site where the government would top up their salaries equal to the collective agreements of publicly run facilities. How this happened dates back to 2002 when then-Premier Gordon Campbell’s B.C. Liberal government removed “successorship rights” from the Labour Code. It meant that when companies were sold, the union agreements weren’t part of the deal. That opened the way for a slew of companies taking advantage of the government’s willingness to privatize long-term care to fire and re-hire employees. In some cases, workers’ pay was cut to $11 an hour from $18, and sick leave gutted to three days a year from 15. The NDP government repealed the changes, but has kept in place Campbell’s other legislation that allows jobs to be contracted out. The B.C. Care Providers Association — the industry’s lobby group — disputes the notion that wages are the problem. It filed a formal complaint with the government last year, blaming regulations for creating critical staff shortages. Last fall, it contended that B.C.’s standards for care aides are too high and that 99 per cent of candidates from outside the province are screened out after completing an $800 competency assessment. According to the association, almost half are told to do a 12-week refresher course or a seven-month, health-care aide training program that costs up to $4,500. The rest, it said, are directed to targeted modules and short courses to address specific shortcomings. The Health Ministry disputes that. It says 30 per cent are registered without further training. But given that the quality of care provided has been so starkly put on view because of COVID, it’s likely that most people would agree with Health Minister Adrian Dix. “I don’t think the solution is to lower those standards,” he said at the time. “The challenge … is to train more care aides.” Regardless, the fact is that residents have not been getting the care they need or want. Just weeks before that first Lynn Valley outbreak, Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie’s released an audit of care homes’ 2016-2018 financial statements. More than 70 per cent of the $1.4-billion annual cost of B.C.’s taxpayer-funded, long-term care goes to corporations and Mackenzie found the government has essentially been handing care providers blank cheques. For-profits generated revenue 12 times that of the non-profit providers. Not only that, for-profit homes had stiffed the government. They had delivered 207,000 fewer hours of care than they were paid for. But they got to keep that money and more because regulations are vague, non-existent or aren’t applied uniformly across the six health authorities. Mackenzie’s report,A Billion Reasons to Care, points out that not only did companies not deliver what they were paid for, they are allowed to claim building expenses at 20 per cent of their revenues compared to the not-for-profits’ nine per cent. They deducted mortgage interest rates considerably higher than market rates, claimed double the depreciation rates as well as unexplained lump sum payments to contractors working for affiliated companies, and had unspecified management fees on top of administrative expenses higher than non-profits. Given a long stream of critical reports, it’s not surprising that the industry lobby group has called for Mackenzie’s resignation, describing her as too “cosy” with the Hospital Employees Union. But it doesn’t change the facts highlighted by COVID, which has killed far too many seniors in Canada. The system is a mess. Care is inadequate and it’s no longer a question of whether something needs to be done. It must be done. Rebuilding it from the ashes of COVID needs careful thought, but the solutions have already been proposed. And it needs quick action because Canada’s seniors haven’t got time to wait. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
149,"Jun 01, 2020","British Columbians have responded overwhelmingly to help seniors in need during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 8,850 volunteers have donated their time to make almost 11,000 grocery deliveries to over 10,000 seniors since late March, whenSafe Seniors, Strong Communitieswas announced and the211 phone line service expandedto match seniors and volunteers. Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’sseniors advocate, said the “unbelievable” response shows how much people care about elders. “When the chips are down, people really care,” she said, “and they really care about seniors.” Volunteers have also made 54,000 virtual visits and check-in phone calls, and delivered 14,000 meals. “In the beginning, we were getting hundreds and hundreds of calls a day,” Mackenzie said from Victoria. “Now we’re getting about 100 contacts a day through the website and calls.” Silviu Toderita decided to volunteer after returning to Vancouver from a trip to Asia. By early March, he started to feel sick. He didn’t think he had COVID-19, but to be safe, he and his partner quarantined at home for two weeks. “If it was hard for us, I thought ‘what it might be like for people in the community who are older and have less people to depend on?’,” Toderita said. “It made me want to reach out and see if there was anything I could do to make people feel less alone and help with their needs.” ThroughCollingwood Neighbourhood House, Toderita was connected with Vancouver senior Judy Smith. Every Thursday evening, Toderita phones Smith to see what groceries she needs. He wears his volunteer name tag when he shops at Save-on-Foods. Altogether, it takes him about four hours of work a week. Most volunteers don’t phone the people they’re helping. Instead, they get a list from a different group of people each week and shop on Wednesday. But that’s a work day for Toderita, so he does his shopping on his day off on Friday. “It’s been a great thing to do and keep my own spirits up,” he said. “Sometimes its easy to get depressed during the (pandemic) situation. Reaching out to people and helping them is a great way to feel better about everything. I’m happy to be doing it.” Smith is glad he’s there to help. She’s 66 and hasretinitis pigmentosa, an incurable genetic disorder that gives hertunnel vision. Going out in public has become a nightmare, she says, because her lack of peripheral vision means she can easily bump into people and inadvertently violate social distancing guidelines. “I can’t tell how far people are from me,” Smith said. “It’s hellish.” One time when Toderita phoned her, Smith said she burst into tears because of the stress of everything in her life. She couldn’t think of anything she wanted for groceries. “He was so kind,” she said. “He didn’t just get off the phone right away. It didn’t make him uncomfortable. He kept chatting and asking, ‘what’s going on?’ He’s a super nice guy!” Smith said other people have offered to help her but Toderita has become “the constant” in her life. “It’s been such a relief to know he’ll call me on Thursday and I’ll have groceries on Friday. Every week,” she said. Safe Seniors, Strong Communities is accessible by phone at 211 or through the websitebc211.ca. Contact information is shared with the United Way’s Better at Home agencies, who connect volunteers and seniors. kevingriffin@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo. Is there more to this story?

150,"May 29, 2020","Every day, Bill Salhany battles his body that’s racked by nerve pains in his hands, legs and neck. “I haven’t left my room today, I just feel … sometimes I feel totally defeated,” the 68-year-old retired RCMP officer said when we spoke by phone. “All I can hope for is a better day tomorrow. I just try get through rest of the day without too much suffering.” Salhany has had a torturous recovery after waking up a quadriplegic following triple bypass heart surgery in July 2018. He spent months on a ventilator followed by a tracheotomy and later contracted double pneumonia. Last summer, he moved into George Pearson Centre, a long-term care home that provides specialized assistance for people with severe physical disabilities, including some who also have cognitive issues, and for people who have mental health and substance-use problems. In addition to dealing with chronic pain, Salhany’s life and the lives of six others have been made more of a misery by a dozen other residents — people with substance-use problems who are bullying and harassing them. In August, he lay powerless in bed when his roommate returned home late at night, drunk, high and threatening. It took a lot of complaints and several weeks before Salhany was moved to another room with a different roommate. But the group of 12 also controlled the canteen, bullying and intimidating others by sometimes by circling around them, said Salhany. “The rest of the population was afraid to go down there. They took it over and even the activity centre in the evenings. They would go and drink alcohol, smoke crack cocaine and marijuana,” Salhany said last week. “I went to management and said, ‘This has got to stop. It’s not right.’ They said they would take care of it.” In December, Vancouver Police were called and made an arrest following “an incident regarding drugs.” That investigation is continuing, according to spokesman Aaron Roed, who also confirmed that police were called to Pearson 18 times in 2019 and have responded to four complaints so far in 2020. “These investigations vary in why the officers were there,” he said. B.C. Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie is aware of drug and alcohol problems at George Pearson and at several other seniors’ housing facilities in the Lower Mainland and at least one in the Interior. She’s talked to B.C. Housing about the problems that arise when people with addictions — some of whom are coming directly from the streets — are mixed with frail seniors and vulnerable people with profound physical disabilities. “We are mixing very different groups of people and they’re not mixing well,” Mackenzie said. “What’s been underappreciated is the impact that they have on the other people who live there. “Nobody is the villain in this,” she said, noting health authorities and B.C. Housing are “trying to find places to house people with mental health issues and addictions, which they’ve determined are disabilities and that’s what this kind of housing is for.” Nurses have also been raising concerns with their union president, Christine Sorensen. Nurses with specialized skills in geriatrics, dementia and palliative care have told her that they are frustrated because they don’t have the skills or the resources to deal with residents who have addictions and very different kinds of mental health problems than the elderly. Sorensen said nurses have filed complaints with the health authorities and to WorkSafeBC that resident have thrown things at them, verbally abused them and harassed them. “Once opioid overdoses were identified as a public health emergency, nurses in long-term care started to see admissions of residents who were not the usual ones,” she said. They were younger, often with brain injuries and more complex mental health issues. “Some are coming from the street before they’re stabilized in acute care and released to long-term care facilities. “And for some people who may have chosen to live on the street for a long time or for those who are not at the long-term care home by choice, it can be incredibly stressful.” Disability advocate Paul Caune says the drug problem at George Pearson predates the opioid crisis. “When I lived there (about 15 years ago), there was a resident with his own room and a lock on the door. Nobody else had locks on door. So, I asked, ‘Who is this guy?’ ‘He’s a drug dealer,’” he said he was told. Caune adds that the difference between then and now is that the residents who were drug users back then “used to be polite and didn’t bother anyone.” Questioned about the complaints that Salhany and others have made about drug use at the facility, Vancouver Coastal Health refused to make anyone available for an interview. But in an emailed statement, spokesperson Carrie Stefanson wrote: “Vancouver Coastal Health is committed to the health, safety and security of everyone in our care, especially those who may be vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. We take any concerns related to these issues extremely seriously.” Residents at George Pearson have complex physical health needs, said the statement. “Like any long-term care home, there are residents who may also have cognitive impairment due to injury or illness, or have mental health or substance use issues that we provide care for as well. Staff are fully trained to provide the level of care all of our residents require.” Vancouver Coastal said it is also working with residents eligible under “safe supply” guidelines brought in as part of B.C.’s response to the COVID and opioid overdose crises. Those guidelines allow qualified practitioners to prescribe for addicts pharmaceutical substitutes for opioids, amphetamines and benzodiazapines as well as cannabis, tobacco and alcohol. At George Pearson, the December arrest didn’t change anything. “A lot of residents don’t go down to the canteen or activity wing anymore because the drug users bully us, they surround you to kick us out,” according to the minutes from the Feb. 20 resident council meeting. “This happens primarily on weekends and evenings. Security cannot do anything, they can only ask them to move along and they are verbally abused. There are no consequences for this behaviour, so it is getting worse.” Then, along came COVID-19. B.C.’s first case of community transmission was reported at the Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver on March 7. Thirteen days later, residents at George Pearson and their families were told the centre was being locked down. Visitors would only be allowed on a compassionate basis and residents could only leave if they were accompanied by a staff member. Everyone complied — except for the 12. Fearful of her husband catching COVID, which would almost certainly kill him, Karen Salhany began writing what has become a blizzard of emails to George Pearson’s manager, Romila Ang, to Vancouver Coastal, to the prime minister, to the premier and to anyone else she could think of. “Little by little, we’re making some gains but not enough to hold them (the drug users) in,” Ang wrote to Karen Salhany in a March 28 email. “We are not the only home facing the same challenges,” Pearson’s manager added. “MDs (medical doctors) are also working on how people can get their illicit substances through medical interventions/alternatives. “I’m sorry I don’t have the magical power to solve this at this time. Rest assured however that I am persevering to find a more global solution.” On March 26, as part of the pandemic battle, the federal and provincial governments agreed to deliver a “safe supply” of drugs — pharmaceutical alternatives to opioids, stimulants, benzodiazepines, cannabis, tobacco and alcohol — to addicts in their homes. But that hasn’t stopped some George Pearson residents from continuing to seek out their drug of choice — crack cocaine. “One day, I finally exploded on the manager and told her she’s got to do something,” said Salhany. On April 22, a wall was built dividing east from west on Ward 4 as a precaution against the spread of COVID-19. Salhany and six others are on the east side of the wing. The 12 residents on the west side live behind a locked door with their own exit to the outside and no access to shared facilities. Nurses, care aides, food services staff and cleaners all put on personal protective equipment before going through the locked door. “They can smoke their cocaine, drink their alcohol, go and meet their pushers. They get the freedom to roam around that we once had. So it’s a bittersweet kind of thing,” Salhany said. “They’re still openly drinking and using crack cocaine and Vancouver Coastal (Health authority) is allowing this and it’s not right.” But Salhany and his family empathize with the drug users. They don’t want to see them tossed on to the street. “They need to have their own facility where they can get some treatment if they agree to it,” Bill said. “They need to be taken care of.” COVID-19 has ripped through long-term care homes, with residents accounting for 82 per cent of the Canadian deaths, tragically highlighting many systemic weaknesses and leading to calls for provincial inquiries or even a national one to help reset how long-term care is delivered. “While we are reimagining long-term care, commingling is one of the issues we need to talk about,” the seniors advocate said. “We need to talk about how we are addressing small, unique populations who not only can’t get their needs met, but are also impinging on the quality of life of others.” There’s a real urgency to addressing the problem because of the growing number of younger people who have brain injuries from lack of oxygen after being revived from opioid overdoses. “Where do we put them?” Mackenzie wonders. “They are alive, but they are incapacitated to the point where they can no longer live independently. But what does that look like?” There are different philosophies about long-term care, including integration (the model in B.C.), segregation (which is being done on Salhany’s ward now due to COVID-19) and grouping people based on their shared histories or interests. Integration, in practical terms, means that in all communities — but especially smaller ones — anyone needing a bed in long-term care is placed in the first one that’s available regardless of their cognitive and physical situation. Residents have no choice in their roommates or mealtime companions. Their only common denominator is that they are no longer able to live independently. “These are communities of people where many of them are living out their last days,” said Mackenzie. “But we are mixing incompatible populations just because we only have one category of complex care.” Most glaringly, it means conflict. But, as crucially, it means residents’ quality of life is equated only with their physical needs without little consideration for their social, emotional or even spiritual needs. In a landmarksurveydone by the seniors advocate, loneliness is one of residents’ most common complaints. The most successful dementia village model is in the Netherlands. Its long-term care homes are smaller and residents are placed in groups based on shared interests such as music as well as common histories that might include having grown up on farms or been professionals. Imagine what that must be like for both the residents and the staff. Then think about what’s happening here. Imagine being frustrated and fearful at work. Imagine being the sole young person living among the frail elderly. And then imagine Bill Salhany — bullied, frustrated and unable to fend for himself. They all deserve better tomorrows. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
151,"May 22, 2020","Like many men his age, 33-year-old Taariq Bali loves to chase his young daughter in the park and to play defence on his hockey team. Unlike most men his age, he can’t do either now, or any other physical activity that causes him to breathe heavily, because he needs a stent inserted into his pulmonary artery. The procedure had been scheduled for March 19, but was among 30,300 surgeries postponed in B.C. to free up hospital space for COVID-19 patients. “I totally understand there is a bigger worldwide problem, I understand why they are doing this,” Bali said of the cancellations. “But I’m a little bit anxious or impatient because I want to get this done.” Bali, who has a genetic condition called Loeys-Dietz, had open-heart surgery two years ago but last November began having troubles breathing again. He has been waiting ever since for the stent that will improve blood flow to his heart, and does not yet have a new date for the surgery. “I was disappointed because I had waited long enough. I also have a one-year-old daughter. Even going up and down the stairs, I get tired. As a 33-year-old guy, when you are huffing and puffing, it is a little frustrating,” said Bali, a technology facilities manager from Delta. Over the last two months, 14,000 patients had procedures cancelled and another 16,000 who had been expecting surgery dates did not get them. In addition, an estimated 24,000 people would typically have been added to the provincial surgical waiting list during this time period, but those referrals didn’t happen. Only the most urgent surgeries proceeded, while all others were put on hold. Nearly 2,000 hospital bedswere emptied but never filled by coronavirus patients because B.C. largely avoided an out-of-control epidemic like the ones that raged in Italy and New York. This week, B.C. slowly began “non-essential” surgeries again but it could taketwo years and $250 millionto catch up. That is partly because of the sheer volume of the backlog, but also because these surgeries will be taking place during a pandemic. They can only proceed at 70 per cent of their previous pace because of the extra protective gear that medical staff have to put on and take off. This week, 2,586 surgeries were rescheduled at 49 locations. “I would describe it as a fairly massive challenge, with huge initial challenges that we are working through now,” Health Minister Adrian Dix said. “It’s going to be a slow start because we still have COVID-19 in the hospitals. We’ve never done this before and we have to get organized.” In interviews with government, medical and academic experts, Postmedia has attempted to gather the most up-to-date information about how this process will unfold over the coming months for patients like Bali. “There are a lot of people seeking relief from their pain or suffering, and the improvement in the quality of their life,” said Jason Sutherland, a professor in UBC’s school of population and public health. “Because so many surgeries have been cancelled and postponed, and a lot of surgeons haven’t put their patients on the wait-list yet, there will be tens of thousands of people waiting.” Dix did not have a breakdown for how the $250 million will be spent, but said the majority will be for salaries: to hire more people and to extend hours of existing medical staff so surgeries can take place in the evenings and on the weekends. “It’s training people, it’s finding people, it’s hiring people, it’s having people doing the work,” he said. “It’s doctors and nurses and medical office assistants and health-care workers and people that clean the surgery rooms.” Thegovernment has saidit will ask part-timers among the 2,404 operating room nurses to work full hours, implore the 1,131 nurses who came out of retirement during the crisis to keep working, offer jobs to B.C.’s entire graduating class of 1,550 nurses this year and try to hire 400 post-anesthesia care nurses. “We are hoping between now and June 15, during that period, to build up to having all of our operating rooms up and running,” Dix said. “We will increase capacity week over week.“ Government officials may also create “high-volume surgical centres” that could specialize in specific types of surgeries. Some procedures that don’t require overnight stays, such as cataract surgeries, will be scheduled in private clinics but paid for with public dollars. A priority in Phase 1 is the 14,000 people who had their procedures cancelled, with an emphasis on serious surgeries that ideally should wait no more than four weeks to be scheduled. That will include most cancer patients who faced delays, and the government acknowledges they may “now need their surgery more urgently” if their conditions worsened during the postponement period. More than 12,000 people waiting for rescheduled procedures were contacted by health officials in the first 10 days of the startup, Dix said Thursday. “So If you are one of those surgeries that’s been deferred, you had a date, I think you can expect a call and you will see action,” he said. Bali has not receive one of those phone calls yet, but Carole Wylie has. Her hip replacement, scheduled for March 18, was sidelined by COVID-19. She was contacted earlier this month and the surgery took place on Wednesday. “I’m really looking forward to being there, lying down and just letting the experts do what they do. Let me wake up with my hip not hurting,” she said on Tuesday. Wylie, who is in her 70s and has been in pain for two years, was frustrated that she wasn’t able to do her volunteer work or move around without her cane. She was thrilled, though, with the health care she had received, until the virus wiped out her surgery date. “Everything was just clicking along smoothly up until the big monster that knocked all of our lives out.” Leading up to her surgery at Burnaby Hospital on Wednesday, she’d had two phone calls screening her for COVID-19 symptoms. As part of these calls, health officials are also asking whether patients are hesitant to receive surgery during a pandemic. Wylie wasn’t worried about catching the virus in the operating room. “I think I’m actually safer in the hospital than I am grocery shopping.” On Friday, Wylie said her surgery was successful and that she was home recovering. Not all surgeries in B.C. were cancelled over the past two months. More than 20,000 urgent procedures for such things as late-stage cancers, cardiac ailments and broken bones went ahead. But screening for new cases was mostly put on hold during that time frame, meaning there were few MRIs, mammographies or colorectal cancer screening. As a result, officials simply don’t know the number and scope of urgent surgeries waiting for them. “There is some not-yet-seen demand. That is what’s keeping me up at night — the person who hasn’t had the screening and may be sick,” Dix said. “I’m concerned about a latent number of urgent surgeries that we don’t know about yet, that we are going to have to address in the early stages.” Many cancer screening services, including for breast, colon and cervix cancers, were suspended to minimize COVID-19 transmission and to allow the system to focus resources on urgent care, the B.C. Cancer agency said in April. While Dix said he doesn’t regret cancelling the surgeries — it was the right thing to do, he argued, if those beds were needed for coronavirus patients — health officials may never know how many people the decision hurt. Delia Oliveira of Surrey, for example,told Postmediathat her husband Chris Walcroft, 50, died on April 15, one month after a procedure to prepare him for life-saving kidney dialysis was cancelled. There has also been worry that sick people have avoided coming to hospitals to seek treatment, for fear of catching the coronavirus. The Heart and Stroke Societysaidthere was an unexplained reduction in hospital visits for the most serious type of heart attack between mid-March and mid-April, compared to the same period last year. Vancouver Coastal Health had a 40 per cent drop in these patients. This week, Dix said people are starting to return to emergency rooms, a reassuring sign they are less scared to come to the hospital during the pandemic. Vancouver Island ERs were closer to pre-COVID levels than hospitals in other parts of the province, he added. In the Vancouver Coastal Health region, surgeons are focusing on the “most time-sensitive” patients first, said Dr. Dean Chittock, vice-president of medicine, and quality and safety. They are “expanding the net” beyond the most urgent cases, which were not postponed, to include treatment for other serious diagnoses, such as bladder cancer, which can be delayed for several weeks but not indefinitely. “We are making sure we are targeting all cancer surgeries to be prioritized, as an example,” he said. It was a staggered start this week as VCH hospitals figured out the best way to move patients safely through their facilities. “Quite frankly it is uncharted territory for us on how to best flow people through in a safe way,” Chittock said. “Honestly, the first week is working though those kinks.” Patients scheduled for surgery at a facility like Vancouver General Hospital, he said, will be asked questions by phone about any COVID-19 symptoms 72 hours and 24 hours before their procedures. If someone has symptoms, the surgery will not be cancelled — it will just allow medical workers to be prepared with extra protective gear, he added. On the day of the surgery, “you can expect to be met by people at the front door, who will ask you a few questions, provide you with a mask, and will help you way-find,” Chittock said. New floor decals, one-way arrows and greeters will help patients navigate the hospital while maintaining social distancing. Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health are using video conferencing to assess patients before their surgeries, rather than have them come into hospitals before their surgery dates. “We are turning about 80 per cent of our pre-admission assessments into virtual,” the Fraser Health president, Dr. Victoria Lee, said a week ago. “We know that COVID-19 is still in our communities and we need to be vigilant in preventing transmission.” The goal, Chittock added, is to get the system as close to “business as usual” as possible. “But it has to be clear that it’s not going to be business as usual for a long time. There still has to be some capacity for the pandemic patients and that does affect how many new patient beds we have available to surgical services.” Hospitals will not be able to ramp up surgeries as quickly as others if they have active COVID-19 outbreaks or if their post-operative patients must recover in the same area as critical-care patients with the coronavirus, Dix said. “It limits our ability in some hospitals, right now.” There are many speed bumps that could slow down the startup, said Sutherland, who works in the centre for health services and policy research in UBC’s school of population and health. “There are possible bottlenecks all over the place. Hospitals may not be able to find anesthesiologists or may not be able to get specialized equipment for some surgeries, say for a joint replacement,” he said. “$250 million is a lot of money and it could do a lot of good, if they use it wisely. It’s less clear how it is going to be used, so we will likely see a lot of variabilities between the health authorities’ use of those funds.” Phase 2, which is expected to start in late June, will include hip and knee surgeries, and dental procedures that cannot be done in dentist’s offices — those that were not urgent enough to be done in the first part of the startup. Rosalie MacDonald, an avid hockey and ringette player who lives in New Westminster, was supposed to have knee surgery on April 29, but it was kiboshed on March 16 and hasn’t been rescheduled yet. She understands the reason for the delay. “But that didn’t reduce the frustration for me. I’ve been off the ice for so long. And also, I just can’t put on my socks the same way I used to be able to do. All those little things like walking up and down the stairs are still not fantastic,” said MacDonald, a data analyst. She had her knee replaced in September, as a result of sports injuries and osteoarthritis. Her pain was reduced but did not go away. Although MacDonald, 47, praises the care she received during the first surgery, an X-ray in February confirmed a followup procedure was necessary. “In the big picture of things, what I need is fairly minor,” MacDonald said. “But I’m really hoping, because it’s a quick surgery, I might not even have to overnight in the hospital, and that I might get squeezed in.” For those even further down the priority list in Phase 3, already-long waits could balloon more. For example, surgery to remove bunions, a common ailment among older women that makes walking painful, had an average waiting time of six months before COVID-19, UBC’s Sutherland said. “They might expect to wait eight to 12 months now,” he said. He co-wrote arecently published academic paperthat argues provinces, including B.C., should reimagine how they manage wait-lists. After urgent cases like cancers and cardiac conditions, Sutherland said, the provincial wait-list process should be modernized to take into consideration things such as whether prolonged surgical waits affect patients’ ability to return to work or to provide care to their children. It is unclear, his paper argued, if hospitals will ever be able to return to their previous levels of surgical cases given the backlog and slowdown in the pace of surgeries. “The pandemic-related cancellation of elective surgeries has created an urgent need for provinces to re-evaluate how they manage their wait lists … amplified by the real risk of subsequent surges of COVID-19,” he wrote. “Surgical prioritization levels currently used by several health authorities were never developed to function either during or after a pandemic.” The provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, has said that every pandemic has a second wave. Dix is hoping surgeries can proceed at full pace through the summer, and then in the fall the ministry can prepare for a resurgence of COVID-19. That could include dividing hospitals in major urban centres, such as the Vancouver and the Victoria areas, into those accepting COVID-19 patients and those open to other patients who need surgery. “We have to continually learn, and learn from the experience we just had, and assess what we are going to do in the case of a second surge,” Dix said. “Try in the fall, rather than stop elective surgeries, (to) reduce elective surgeries but still do some so we won’t be set back as far by a second surge.” lculbert@postmedia.com twitter.com/loriculbert CLICK HEREto report a typo.

152,"May 19, 2020","On May 19, music manager, radio personality and force of natureBruce Allenturns 75 years old. But don’t expect him to slow down or — God forbid — retire. “People say, ‘75 years old, why don’t you stop?’” Allen said. “I say ‘To be honest, I’m still winning. What else am I going to do?’” So he’ll continue to guide the careers ofBryan Adams,Michael Buble,Bob RockandJann Arden, among others. And the legendary loudmouth will continue to do his daily “Reality Check” commentaries on CKNW, which tend to stir the pot. “Do I like getting people angry?” he said. “I like getting them to think. I don’t care if you agree with me. They say ‘Bruce, do you want to see any of your mail?’ Never. Never. I try so hard to try and get my artists not to look at social media, because it’s crippling.” This interview was done before Bryan Adams set off a social media firestorm with anInstagram postblaming the COVID-19 crisis on “bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy bastards.” Normally it’s Allen that’s making the controversial statements. He may be 75, but he can still be quite fearsome if you get on the wrong side of him. It’s been his stock in trade for decades, and it’s worked, from his days guidingBachman-Turner OverdriveandLoverboyto Adams and Buble. “It’s been a long run, a very successful run, and I’m blessed to have the talent that I’ve had,” he said. “Bryan’s sold 60 million records, Michael Buble’s up real close, 60 million too. Loverboy sold a lot of records, had a lot of big hits. I want to stay around ‘til I can hit the 200 million mark.” He laughs. “I’m not that far away, but we’re not selling records like that anymore. (The music business has) completely changed.” Growing up in Dunbar in the 1950s, Allen fell in love with rock ‘n’ roll. In the mid-‘60s he dropped out of University of B.C. to become a music agent, eventually running an agency that booked 17 clubs. “I went over to Lasseter’s Den, a club at Commercial Drive and Broadway,” he recounts. “A friend of mine was involved in the ownership and said, ‘We’ve got this new band in here. Bruce, you spend all your time with music, can you fix these guys, sit them down and teach them?’” The band was called 5 Man Cargo, and played British invasion stuff when Vancouver was known as a rhythm and blues town. But times were changing, and Allen seized the moment. “All of a sudden that club took off because they were singing stuff from The Hollies and The Beatles, all the stuff from England,” he said. “I managed to start a booking agency by using that band to get into other locations. I said, ‘I’ll give you this band, but you’ve got to help me, I’d like to have the booking rights to your club.’ I ended up with 17 rooms.” Allen’s big break was in the early ’70s, when Randy Bachman exited The Guess Who and moved west with his new band Brave Belt, which became Bachman-Turner Overdrive. Allen became their manager, and they built up a following by touring incessantly. When BTO scored massive hits with songs like Let It Ride and Takin’ Care of Business, they toured the world. “It was a really good learning experience,” Allen said. “BTO went international, so I went to London, went to Europe, went to Australia, went to Japan. I got a really good base.” In 1972 he became partners withSam Feldman, who took over the booking agency when Allen concentrated on management. To say they’ve had a tempestuous relationship is an understatement — in 1979 Feldman split to form his own office, taking the staff with him. But Allen and Feldman remain financial partners. When BTO broke up, Calgary bar owner Lou Blair asked Allen to co-manage Loverboy. Allen used his BTO experience and contacts to turn them into his second huge act. Then came Adams, who went to another level, and shares Allen’s work ethic. “Here’s a stat — Bryan Adams has done 10 shows a month for 15 years,” said Allen. “Add it up, 120 shows a year, every year. But he can go anywhere. Pick a market, throw a dart, OK, we’ll go there.” This is no idle boast. Adams is a huge international star, and has played all over the place, from Asia to the Middle East, Africa to South America. “When you stand in front of the pyramids playing a gig, it kind of gets surreal — you can’t actually believe you’re there,” said Allen. Some gigs have been a bit stressful. In Pakistan, “we’ve been taken in by armoured car, with armed guards beside you, in front and back, to get to where you’re going to play.” The gig itself was crazy. “We were playing on a golf course and people were going wild,” said Allen. “I remember cops were hitting (fans) with batons and rope to keep them back from the barricade. Adams comes over, says ‘Jesus Christ, this is terrifying.’” There was a surprise after the show — they couldn’t leave because Pakistan’s then-president Pervez Musharraf insisted that they stick around for a big dinner the following night. “It was all the pomp and circumstance those things can be, and all of a sudden Musharraf got up to make a speech to his people, and said, ‘Now Bryan would like to come and speak,’ Allen relates. “Whoa. That was gold; he had to really pull that together, he did a great job. Next day we left, and six weeks later (terrorists) blew up the hotel we were staying at in Pakistan, the Marriott Hotel.” Allen has a special bond with Adams. “I was in Singapore with Buble and I had a night off,” he said. “Adams was playing Rogers Arena, and I’d never missed Bryan in Vancouver in history. I figured out if I left that day from Singapore I could make it (for the Adams show), then fly back the next day to Singapore for Michael. “I got there about four o’clock in the afternoon, went in his dressing room. When he came in he couldn’t believe it. It was quite emotional stuff. We’re really, really close friends. He’s such a workaholic, it fits my regimen perfectly.” He decided to manage Buble at the urging of producerDavid Foster. “The record came out, and I remember (the agent) calling me from the States,” said Allen. “Let’s go over the (ticket) counts. Phoenix, 13. Seattle, 86. But you know what? The kid worked his arse off. There’s not a more personable guy on TV or radio than Michael Buble. He can sell himself. He’s a great performer live, and all of a sudden it started to happen. “I remember the record company head that sat in front of me and Michael,Tom Whalley. Tom says ‘I already have Frank Sinatra. Why do I need (another one)?’ And Michael said ‘Yeah, but Frank Sinatra’s dead.’ Then he said ‘Don’t let the music die with him, Tom.’ He said it, not me. Brilliant in a way.” Buble is now one of the most popular live performers in the world. He took three years off to be with his family when his son battled cancer, but started touring again last year. He was about to go back on the road when COVID-19 hit. “His tour was supposed to start in April,” said Allen. “We had to move it, so it was going to start in September. Now it’s starting — we hope — in February or March of next year.” Allen normally spends 150 days a year on the road. He leaves the running of the office to his staff, which is made up of eight women and one man. “I’ve got staff here that have been here 35 years, 40 years,” he said. “They can finish my sentences, that’s why we get things done. The people have been here a long time and know how to do it. I can’t do it all, not a chance. Randy Berswick is in his 60s. It’s the only job he’s had since he was an adult.” Life is good. Allen has been with his partner Katy-Ann for two decades (“She says ‘I’m the unicorn and you’re the bull’”), his son Quinn works with Adams and his daughter Claire has been working in radio. He even seems to be getting along, somewhat, with partner/foe Feldman. “We go for a walk now every Sunday,” said Allen. “Like two old lions with no teeth.” jmackie@postmedia.com"
153,"May 16, 2020","Carmen Aguilera is a light sleeper. At night, in the room she shares with her two daughters, she is always alert. When 11-year-old Amy has a seizure, her eyes fly open and she fumbles for her daughter’s medication. Many nights, she doesn’t sleep at all. In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Aguilera and her husband Jocsan Diaz asked their daughter’s caregiver to stop coming to their home in Port Coquitlam. The risk of someone inadvertently transmitting the virus to Amy, who has cerebral palsy and a weakened immune system, was too great. Since then, Amy’s care has fallen on her parents alone. “Someone has to be there at all times,” said Aguilera. “You can’t cook, you can’t shower, you can’t go to the next room for a moment.” The family qualifies for 12 hours of home care each week, giving Aguilera time to get groceries, run errands and maybe take a little time for herself. Now, “there is no time,” a situation that’s unlikely to change until the pandemic ends. Aguilera injured her left shoulder a long time ago lifting Amy. Lately, her right shoulder has been aching, too. “Thank God for my husband,” she said. “He works all day, but when he is done, I can have a shower.” Barb MacLean calls B.C.’s family caregivers the “front-line workers behind closed doors.” Because they aren’t paid as they take care of their loved ones, it is difficult to immediately understand the toll the pandemic is taking on them, said the executive director ofFamily Caregivers of B.C. An estimated one million people in B.C. provide unpaid care for adult family members. That number does not include parents who care for children with complex medical needs. Unpaid caregivers provide about three-quarters of the care for seniors receiving care at home in Canada. Replacing the care with paid caregivers would cost more than $25 billion a year in Canada, $3.5 billion in B.C., according to the Health Council of Canada. Burnout is already a serious issue, with 31 per cent of B.C. caregivers reporting distress in a2017 surveyby the Office of the Seniors Advocate, the second-highest rate in Canada. “We know many caregivers are exhausted and ready to break,” said MacLean. “As health authorities cut back to essential services during the pandemic, people are getting even closer to that line. We need to find them and help them before they break.” In April, the B.C. governmentannounced a $500,000 grantto Family Caregivers of B.C. to support people who are caring for elderly family members or friends. The not-for-profit organization runs a caregiver helpline and provides education, resources, counselling and assistance navigating the health-care system. “Many B.C. seniors count on their spouses, children and close friends to help them stay at home and manage chronic conditions,” B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said at a press conference. “The circumstances of COVID-19 have added weight and worry to the task.” MacLean describes the people who perform these tasks as “the invisible caregivers,” adding that they are also vulnerable. “If caregivers aren’t getting support, one sick person can easily become two people,” she said. “We know that caregivers are at a higher risk of illness themselves.” While each caregiver’s situation is unique, one of the keys to remaining healthy is to have some time away from caregiving, said B.C.’s seniors advocate, Isobel Mackenzie. But with adult day programs cancelled due to the ban on large gatherings, time away “may not be possible anymore,” she said. “We need to be thinking about what else we can do.” MacKenzie said many caregivers who are seniors themselves may be able to handle a few weeks, or months, without a break, but the “cumulative effect” remains to be seen. “I don’t think we’ll see the full effect of this for some time. In the future, we may see it manifesting itself with more people needing to go into care. Perhaps they would have been able to stay at home longer if there had been support.” For families caring for children with complex disabilities, the pandemic presents similar challenges, said Brenda Lenahan, the founder of a Facebook group for B.C. parents of “medically complex kids.” Financial challenges that existed before COVID-19 have been magnified, she said. Many families rely on one income to make ends meet, with one parent staying at home to provide care. The costs of medical equipment, such as wheelchairs, often exceed government funding, while accessible vehicles and homes cost much more. On top of financial concerns, many families have extra anxiety about their children’s health during the pandemic. “Our kids are complex in a way that makes them vulnerable,” said Lenahan. “Many of us started isolating early, before the government put orders in place, and many will stay isolated for longer.” She said a reduction in respite services affects parents physically — “We have less opportunities for fitness, a bike ride (or) a run” — as well as mentally. “It’s an incredible load to bear. Some of us are tasked with keeping our kids alive. Add to that the pressure of keeping our kids safe from COVID-19, and it’s very, very hard.” Some families have chosen to cancel their home care for safety reasons, while others may have caregivers who are unable or unwilling to make home visits during the pandemic, said Pam Horton, chair of the board of directors for Disability Alliance B.C. “The impact on the person requiring the care is significant,” she said. “If a person lives alone and can’t get out of bed themselves, it’s very difficult.” Horton said she is aware of a woman with a disability who has had to ask her mother to come to her home during the night because her usual caregiver is unable to do the overnight shift. “I don’t see the easing of restrictions changing this until such a time that we can fully guarantee that it is safe,” she said. Horton has been encouraging people to write letters to the government “to paint the picture” and ask for more support for people with disabilities, including more personal protective equipment for caregivers. Increased awareness in the broader community could also help caregivers get through the pandemic, said MacLean. “We need to be a caregiver-aware culture more than ever.” That could mean giving support in non-medical ways, such as mowing a neighbour’s lawn, offering to get groceries or bringing a meal. “You might live next door to a caregiver and not know it,” she said. “If there’s something we can take from this time, it might be more of a willingness to ask for help and a willingness to give help.” Family Caregivers of B.C. tries to help people build “networks of support,” so that they are receiving both formal and informal help, such as routine assistance with tasks and spontaneous gestures that help them feel connected. “Simple things can make a difference,” said MacLean. “A bouquet of flowers, a phone call, someone saying ‘Count on me to get you groceries every Tuesday.’ Even the small gestures can create a bright spot in someone’s day, which allows them to keep going.” For Ted VanAsseldonk, the bright spot is nature. The retired firefighter became the primary caregiver for his wife, Helga, after she had a life-altering stroke in 2015. Realizing that to be a successful caregiver, he needed some time for himself, VanAsseldonk began hiking early in the morning, before his wife was awake. He also arranged for his daughters to help him for several hours each week and started leading group hikes in the mountains near his house in Abbotsford. While the pandemic has forced him to hit pause on the group outings, VanAsseldonk is still hiking. “Something as simple as a walk gives me something to look forward to,” he said. “It’s a chance to leave my cares behind for a while. Without the exercise, I might become a little depressed.” Occasionally, VanAsseldonk will encounter another person on the trail. A moment of conversation, at a safe distance, helps him feel connected to his community. “I get home, and I’m ready for the day,” he said. “It’s not easy, but I’m doing all right.” •Family Caregivers of B.C.runs a helpline that allows people to “tell their story,” receive emotional support and get help navigating the health-care system. They also provide education through webinars and workshops, while advocating for caregivers to be recognized at point of diagnosis. Caregivers can access support by calling the helpline at 1-877-520-3267. • B.C.’sSafe Seniors, Strong Communitiesprogram, accessed bydialling 211, matches seniors who need support with non-medical essentials with volunteers in their community who are willing to help with things like picking up groceries and medications, securing meals or providing a friendly virtual visit. Since being launched, the program has facilitated 12,193 virtual visits, 2,957 grocery deliveries, and 2,782 meals, thanks to 5,500 volunteers. • The Facebook groupB.C.

154,"May 14, 2020","Nearly all B.C. care facilities that had employees working at multiple locations have come up with plans to limit those workers to one site, a move that is meant to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 among vulnerable populations. Yet there are many unanswered questions about the process, including how much a planned pay increase for affected employees will cost. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry ordered that staff movement between long-term care facilities be restricted to ensure that staff work in only one facility, with few exceptions. The order took effect last month, but it has not been fully implemented. B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said on Thursday there were 545 facilities that had people working at multiple sites, and 495, or 91 per cent, have completed single-site plans. All employees who are subject to a single-site order are entitled to the hourly wage equivalent of the applicable Health Employers Association of B.C. collective agreement, at both publicly funded and private operators. The province has estimated there are 45,000 care-home employees, and 7,350 had jobs at multiple facilities. It is unclear how many care-home employees will qualify to have their pay bumped up. Employees have not yet had their wages increased, and that is not expected to happen until early June. In the meantime, the province is working with health authorities to gather detailed information about sites that are not members of the Health Employers Association of B.C. on the compensation for all staff members. “This is a time-consuming and somewhat complex task, as there are many collective agreements in health care, and some facilities that do not have collective agreements at all,” said Dix. Once it has gathered and analyzed all of the necessary information, the province will distribute funding to health authorities, which will pass it along to service providers and ensure it goes to frontline staff. The pay increase will be retroactive. Dix said the initial estimate was that it would cost $10 million per month to increase workers’ pay, and that figure was meant to provide a sense of the overall cost of the wage increases. Until single-site plans are approved at all facilities, a more accurate estimate will not be available. “I think that the results, I suspect, will be slightly higher than that,” he said. He added that the province is assuming responsibility for the cost of the wage increases because they are the result of a public health order. The B.C. Care Providers Association said the complicated process and the length of time it is taking to work out the details is concerning. “Uncertainty, especially during a global pandemic, only adds to heightened anxiety for staff and for operators,” said vice-president of public affairs Mike Klassen. “A lot of people are under an incredible amount of anxiety right now, and I feel terrible for them and I wish this would have gone more smoothly and more quickly, but it’s taking a long time and I think we have to understand that there is a cost to that.” Klassen said that for many operators, single-siting was a simple process, and other provinces, such as Alberta, were able to get money flowing quickly to cover COVID-19 related expenses. He said it is great that the pay increase will be retroactive, but people will have been waiting for two months when it arrives. “I think all the intentions are noble, it’s just that this process has become extraordinarily complicated,” Klassen said. Association president Daniel Fontaine said $10 million per month is unlikely to cover the cost of the wage increases, but he is hopeful the province will live up to its promise to make up the difference. “I’m always a little bit nervous until I see what the actual arrangements are and what has been put on the table in terms of the amount of money, how the money is going to be flowing,” Fontaine said. Wages aren’t the only COVID-19 expense care providers are facing. Despite the fact that the province pledged $10 million under its EquipCare BC program to enhance infection prevention at long-term and assisted living facilities, Fontaine said there are many costs, such as protective equipment and extra deep cleaning, that won’t be covered for a majority of facilities. Overtime and sick leave are also factors. Facilities have been told to keep track of their expenses, but it’s not clear when or if those will be reimbursed. The association has already heard of at least one small operator that anticipates it will be bankrupt by the end of June. jensaltman@postmedia.com twitter.com/jensaltman"
155,"May 08, 2020","There are small pebbles, shells or shards of sea glass in the pockets of most of my mother’s jackets and mine, reminders of the beaches that we’ve walked together. It began more than 30 years ago at the tide line along Victoria’s Dallas Road where we each picked one for the other. As Prairie women, we’ve always marvelled at the ocean’s spectacular, surprising and precious bounty. I remember helping Mom wrap sand dollars and fragile skeletons of long-dead sea stars found on Hornby Island with the same care as her beloved Belleek china — shell pattern, of course — to take back to Saskatchewan with her. Her collages made from shells, bull kelp, driftwood and pebbles hang at our family’s lakefront cottage. Now 91, Mom’s beach-walking days are over which is why for Mother’s Day, I went to the beach and found a few treasures — a black stone embedded with a jagged, white heart, green sea glass, a small swirled sea shell and two halves of a tiny mussel shell. Like so many other Canadians, I won’t be seeing my Mom on Sunday, Mother’s Day. It’s a day that once, not that long ago, my Mom and I derided as a Hallmark holiday, a made-up celebration created to sell greeting cards. But, as she’d always note, there is a proper church holiday called Mothering Sunday. Its roots are in 16th century Britain when during Lent people would visit their “mother” church with children coming from afar, often bringing gifts for their own mothers. But in the midst of a pandemic, it doesn’t seem silly to tell your mother that you love her on a specific day. In fact, if all our physical distancing and staying at home is teaching us anything, it’s that telling people we love them at any time and on any day is a good thing because life is short and uncertain. Even the usual gifts of cards, flowers and sweets carry more significance. For our isolated matriarchs, they are among the few tangible things that we can send to help comfort and all the better if they’re handmade. Five centuries on from the original Mothering Sunday, this Mother’s Day will be like no other, with brunches shared over Zoom, virtual hugs on FaceTime, waves from the parking lot and hands pressed together divided by glass. Among the few able to spend time with their children are the harried, young mothers whose children’s patience for more family time is wearing thin. For first-time mothers, it will still likely to be months before they can introduce their babies to extended families. Their babies, like their grandmothers, are at greater risk of infection, which means first-time grandmothers may have to make do with waving through windows. But it is the matriarchs who are suffering most. To try to save our elders from the pandemic that is claiming them at a terrifying rate, they’re now more isolated than ever from contact. Not being able to sit together, to hug, to hold hands, to reassure has taken a toll on all of us. But it’s especially difficult for elders like Mom who have been locked down in care homes for several months now. Isolating them has been a necessary precaution from the public-health point of view, which has had their physical protection from the virus as its priority. But for my Mom and thousands of others, their physical protection from COVID has its own harms. Increased anxiety, loneliness and sleeplessness from no activity. All were factors in Mom’s fall in late March. Frailer, weaker and no longer able to live independently, she’ll spend Mother’s Day in hospital. It will be another anxious day because Monday is moving day. She won’t be going home. She’ll be going to a care home and a suite that none of us has seen except on video and floor plans. Movers have done their best to position her furniture and unpack her belongings. But there will no pictures on the wall, no family photos and, heaven knows where the rose bowl filled with shells will be. She’ll be greeted and cared for by masked strangers, who are among the heroes of the pandemic. Over time, they will become part of our family. From afar, we do what we can. But you can’t make a new place a home through FaceTime. No virtual hug on Zoom can allay the strangeness of it all or soothe all of our fears about the unforeseeable future. On Sunday, I’ll be thinking about all of the mothers especially those separated from loved ones and of those families grieving for mothers lost to COVID. I plan to cut a few of my pandemic pansies and put them in vase inherited from my beloved grandmother. Then, I’ll call Mom and promise to bring her new treasures as soon as I can. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
156,"May 05, 2020","Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry cried when she announced, back in early March,the first COVID-19 outbreakin a long-term care home in Canada, as she was so worried about the deadly virus preying on its vulnerable residents. The Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver would go on to have the worst seniors’ home outbreak in B.C., and would also record Canada’s first coronavirus death: a male resident who passed away on March 8. There was mounting pressure inside the care home at that time — from worried residents and their anxious families, and from scared staff who scrambled to respond to the fast-spreading virus. “For the first week or so it was very, very, very tough,” Lynn Valley’s director of care, Betty Wills, said in her first interview since the outbreak began two months ago. “It was really scary because of the unknown factor. We’ve had outbreaks before, but this one is very different. I went through SARS, and this is totally different. … I’ve (never) seen as much fear in my whole career. “And we were the very first in Canada. All eyes are on us.” Over the last two months at the 204-bed facility, 79 staff and residents tested positive for the coronavirus, and 20 residents died. The outbreak at the care home was declared over on Monday after 28 straight days of no new confirmed cases. “We have a high degree of confidence that there is not currently a circulating COVID infection within the facility,” Dr. Michael Schwandt, a medical health officer for Vancouver Coastal Health, said Tuesday. The announcement left Wills cautiously optimistic. “The whole team was actually celebrating. And yet we are still on guard.” Indeed, COVID-19 has hit seniors’ centres hard in B.C., and even harder in provinces such as Quebec and Ontario where the military was called in to help staff the homes. As of Tuesday, 72 of the 121 deaths in B.C. — 60 per cent — have been residents of long-term care facilities. About 35 seniors’ homes have had coronavirus infections. Haro Park in Vancouver’s West End, which had the second-worst number of COVID infections and 11 deaths, says all its cases have recovered, but the outbreak there hasn’t been declared over yet. The lockdown on visitors to seniors’ facilities continues, so families will still not be able to enter the Lynn Valley centre. But the end of the outbreak gives Diane Barnhill hope that her 96-year-old mother, a resident of the home, will continue to remain virus-free. “I’m quite relieved,” she said Tuesday. “I’m just so grateful that at her age, because she would be very vulnerable, that she has been able to avoid being affected.” Lynn Valley employees will continue to don masks and shields to help guard against COVID returning to the facility. But with the outbreak over, they no longer have to wear medical gowns, which reduces the fear factor for many residents. “This is people’s home,” Schwandt said. Some Lynn Valley staff have publicly complained the home was too slow to respond to the outbreak. Some families have also complained about an initial lack of information coming from the facility. Wills defended her centre, saying she had a strong team who worked well together during the crisis, although she conceded communication could have been better during those frenzied first few days. “The one thing that I would like to improve is the communication, because at first we were so focused on working out what our next step is. In hindsight, we will communicate a lot sooner and then we will be a lot better, I think.” In the first week or so, she explained, there was a shortage of staff because people were off sick, or had been asked to self-isolate, or were nervous about coming to work. “For the first couple of days, we didn’t have enough staff because they were so scared to come in,” said Wills, adding those who were there did their best. “We were all working really, really hard, the whole team. We were working 16, 18 hours a day.” The deaths were very emotional for the staff, many of whom had worked at the facility for many years, she said. Often, they were the last people with the residents before they passed away. “We need to take the place of the family. … We make sure that we can make them comfortable. If they are short of breath, we make sure they have the oxygen on,” Wills said. “All your emotions will sometimes paralyze you. It is the separation of doing your job well and doing it from the heart.” Back in early March, news of COVID hitting her elderly mother’s care home was a big worry for Barnhill. “At first the news was devastating. People were phoning me and saying, ‘Your mother is in there and it is so terrible,'” she recalled. “It was starting to sound worse and worse, and everyone was getting concerned, and everything was shutting down — churches, stores, dentists.” Eventually, though, Lynn Valley started daily communication to update families about what was happening inside. Barnhill, a retired nurse, believes the facility did a good job under the circumstances. Barnhill can phone her mother and also waves to her, while standing below her balcony. “I can see that she has energy, and looks good, and she can see me. So it is reassuring.” Vancouver Coastal Health officials on Tuesday defended their response at Lynn Valley, arguing it ultimately reduced the spread of the virus in a second wing of the facility and helped to achieve better outcomes in other long-term care homes. “Once it was determined that an outbreak was taking place, I think that actions moved quite quickly. We saw a lot of increased use of PPE,” Schwandt said. On March 7, a VCH support team was created to respond to the Lynn Valley outbreak, and that initiative morphed into “SWAT and Rapid Response teams” that were then used in other VCH long-term care facilities. There have been 17 long-term care outbreaks in the Vancouver Coastal area but, after Lynn Valley and Haro, extensive coronavirus spreading among residents in other homes was more limited. The rapid response team includes a microbiologist, infection prevention and control specialists, and health-care workers with expertise in infections. It ensures there is enough personal protection equipment on site, and that staff know how to use it. “In providing those services, we really hope to reduce fears among staff and residents and let them know from early on that support is available,” Schwandt said. Another early lesson learned from Lynn Valley was that COVID symptoms among the elderly can be more mild than in the younger population, and can include diarrhea, fatigue and confusion, Schwandt said. That has led to early testing when these milder symptoms are seen in care homes. “In terms of the early recognition of an outbreak, we’ve learned a lot from the Lynn Valley experience,” he said. lculbert@postmedia.com Twitter:@loriculbert"
157,,"The Haro Park care home in Vancouver’s West End announced Friday it no longer had any known COVID-19 cases, after having one of the worst outbreaks in B.C. When the first coronavirus case was announced at Haro Park on March 18, it became the third seniors’ home in B.C. with an outbreak. And at the height of the outbreak, in early April, there were 37 infected residents and 27 infected staff. In total, 11 residents have died. On May 1, the home said everyone else had recovered but, until it is cleared by the medical health officer, it will continue to be locked down. Care aide Dorothy Nelson has worked at the home for more than 35 years. She tells us what life is like for essential workers like her during a health-care crisis. The conversation has been edited for length. Q: What has the job been like since the arrival of COVID-19? A: It was more fear, more anxiety, and more worry for the residents and how many of our residents we were going to lose, because of the fact that the majority of people who have adverse or the strongest reaction to COVID are seniors. So we knew we were in trouble. … And then knowing that the families can’t be there, that was super hard to know that you were everything to them. Q: How did the deaths affect you and your co-workers? A:You develop a bond with these people and you develop a bond with their families. For us, it is always hard when we lose a resident. (COVID) made it harder because we lost so many so quickly. You didn’t really get over the shock. There was no processing time. Q: You had to wear gowns, gloves and masks for some patients in the past, but now you must with everyone. How has that changed your daily routine? A:You have to add two to three minutes to don all the PPE before you enter the room. Then you have to take care of the person, whether it is feeding, bathing, toileting, whatever. Then you’ve got to doff, and you have to wash your hands three to four times during that period as you are doffing, so it added probably another 15 minutes of time per resident. And it was tough when the person was struggling. Q:Are there enough minutes in the day to care for your residents? A: No. Not to do it properly, the way your heart wants to take care of these residents. … When you go into a room and you have 15 minutes — 15 minutes and that’s at the outside — to get somebody out of bed, to wash their face and hands, to brush their teeth, to do their hair, to make them feel good. Q: How did it affect your co-workers when dozens got infected? A:It added to the fear. But then once the staff started recovering and coming back, and jumping right back into the thick of things, once the first ones came back, then everybody calmed down about it. Q:Your department usually has six workers, but you are down to three? A:One reason we are short is because of the directive that care aides can’t work in more than one facility. One of our evening staff … had a full-time job at another facility, so she chose to work there. The other casuals that we had, that would pick up shifts at Haro Park, don’t pick up shifts anymore. Q:So are you working extra shifts? A: Oh my goodness, I’ve worked 31 out of the last 35 days. I have worked, out of those, five double shifts. There is no choice, you just have to do it. Q:Do you worry about your own health? A:Sometimes I do because I have a touch of asthma and I’m 58, so it could affect me a lot harder. But for me, with having gone through other outbreaks, it is a lot of common sense: it’s hand washing, it’s hand sanitizing, it’s keeping your hands away from your face. We wear masks, we have eye protection on, goggles, gloves and masks. And you keep social distance. Q:Your reaction to Haro Park being COVID-free? A:Haro Park has done an amazing job. In my opinion, they did the best they could do in a very short amount of time. … It was a relief, but we are finding that we are still apprehensive about the possibility of it coming back. So everyone is still pretty hyper vigilant. Nelson chairs the Haro Park local of the Hospital Employees’ Union lculbert@postmedia.com twitter.com/loriculbert CLICK HEREto report a typo.

158,"May 02, 2020","The association representing many of B.C.’s care home operators says the delay in restricting workers to a single site during the COVID-19 pandemic is partly the result of confusion around wage structure. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry first made the mandatory order on March 26, limiting movement of staff at public and private long-term care facilities as a means to reduce transmission of the novel coronavirus. As of Thursday, 276 of the 545 facilities in B.C. with multiple-facility employees had completed a single-site plan. On Saturday, Daniel Fontaine, the CEO of the B.C. Care Providers Association, called on the provincial government to “do a reset” on its wage-levelling policy, which appears to require public and private care home operators to bring all staff up to the highest master collective agreement rate, in favour of a system of “hero pay.” “We advocated for single site, and we supported wage levelling, but our assumption was that if you were working at three sites, you’d go to working at one site full-time, and if you were missing a bit of income, the wage levelling would top you up,” he explained. Instead, Fontaine said he believes “everybody will go to the union rate,” but the details of how that will work in non-union and non-profit care homes is unclear to him, as is when the top-up will begin, how long it will continue, and who will pay the difference. The confusion and complexity of the issue is causing delays in the implementation of the single-site protocol, he said. Fontaine would like to see the government implement a system similar to Ontario, where long-term staff are getting an extra $4 per hour for pandemic pay. “We would encourage the minister to do a reset (on the wage-levelling policy),” he said. “Give workers hero pay and get that money into their hands, instead of having this mired in committees for months.” On Thursday, B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix gave an update on the single-site proposal, explaining that of the 45,000 care home employees in B.C. (including long-term care facilities, assisted living facilities, private hospitals, stand-alone extended care hospitals and provincial mental health facilities), 7,350 employees had jobs at multiple facilities. Of the 545 facilities with multiple-facility employees, 276 had completed a single-site plan, while all others had plans underway, he said. “We expect more, significant progress next week.” About two-thirds of the people who have died of COVID-19 in B.C. are associated with long-term care. In response to a reporter’s question, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said “a good proportion” of the outbreaks in long-term care homes have been traced to staff, and staff moving between facilities was an “important consideration in at least a number of them, particularly early on.” “(The single-site protocol) is a measure that I believe is important, not only for this pandemic, but as we consider how we best protect our seniors and elders in our long-term care sector going forward,” she said. Dix has estimated the salary equalization will cost $10 million a month. But Fontaine said he’s fielding questions from private and non-profit care homes whose staff do not work at multiple facilities saying they can’t afford to raise pay and questioning if and when the government will chip in. “I think this is very well-intentioned, but it is an incredibly complex issue that can’t be sorted out quickly,” he said. “They went too deep and too far and made it too complex.” —With Postmedia News files gluymes@postmedia.com twitter.com/glendaluymes CLICK HEREto report a typo.

159,"Apr 16, 2020","Back in January, selling toilet paper never crossed Kristin Vekteris’s mind when she was thinking about innovations for 2020. As chief brand officer for Earls Restaurants, she and her team were focused on revamping menus and looking forward to a busy patio season. But by mid-March, before government orders and out of concern for the safety of staff and customers, the Vancouver-based chain closed table service at its 66 North American restaurants and switched to takeout and delivery. Staff had to be laid off, but chefs and managers were kept on. On April 2,Earls Grocerywas officially a thing with curbside pickup and delivery. It’s a specialty store that doesn’t just sell menu items like its popular ribs, frozen and ready to reheat. It has freezer packs of meat and produce packs along with flour, bacon, coffee, and kits for making such things as bread, pizza and chef specialties. And, oh yes, toilet paper. “As the executive team, we were on Google hangouts for hours every day after the restaurants were closed,” Vekteris said by phone. “We were hearing from our staff and we listened to our guests.” They heard what we’ve all been experiencing. Grocery store shelves were picked clean of essentials. There were long checkout lines and people were worried about the risks they were taking just to get food. “We quickly started thinking, what could we offer?” she said. “And pretty quickly it was obvious. We have access to a supply chain. It was right there for us.” “We looked at what people were having trouble accessing. Yeast. Flour. Toilet paper and soap. … We had lots of extra toilet paper with the restaurants closed. So that was just a fun one that we added to make people’s lives easier. Now, it’s one of our top sellers.” The biggest challenge, Vekteris said, is trying to anticipate what people want and need. Initially, it was comfort food. She and her team expected ribs to be a big seller. Demand exceeded supply, sending the procurement team scrambling to get more. People are also scarfing down a lot more dessert. But as time goes by, they’re asking for different things. Sriracha sauce is one of the latest things to be added to the list. Innovation is a bright spot against the bleak backdrop of COVID’s rising death tolls, unemployment numbers, rising debt and personal anxieties. Survival is driving much of it. Distillers have pivoted to making hand sanitizer. Some brewers are selling yeast to meet fledgling bread makers’ demand. People are making bread because, well, just because. Even as governments are doling out billions of dollars to stave off personal and business bankruptcies, the economic forecasts are terrifying. In the restaurant sector, there are estimates that only 30 per cent will survive. Tourism and travel-related businesses are likely to suffer similar losses. Already struggling oil, gas and media companies teeter on the edge of extinction. So, too, are shuttered retailers. But innovation isn’t only being driven by survival. It’s also being driven by kindness and a desire to be useful when everything seems to be spiralling out of control. AtTRIUMF, engineers have refocused from particle research to designing a simpler ventilator. Machines at the facility have been repurposed to produce face shields and straps to make it more comfortable for health-care workers to wear masks for extended periods. In cities, traffic patterns have changed now that offices have been emptied and employees laid off or working from home. Municipalities are revamping street and road patterns to accommodate physical distancing with increased numbers of walkers and cyclists. With no schedule for the crisis to end beyond the hoped-for day when a vaccine is available, only the bravest or most foolish prognosticators are predicting what a post-COVID world will look like. Who even knows what we will look like after all our bread-making, dessert-eating and DIY-haircutting, let alone how much of this retooling, rejigging and repurposing will become permanent? Who knows whether we will ever return to old habits of eating out or maintain the new ones of eating in? Who knows whether we’ll ever go back to the office or end up forever working at home? Who can predict when we’ll be able to travel again or whether we’ll ever return to our old consumer ways? Regardless, we will somehow manage muddle through this, making it up as we go along, as B.C. Premier John Horgan so honestly said earlier this week. That’s not to say that we will emerge unscathed. Many will bear the scars of the pandemic and suffer from grief and loss caused by it. Still, we will rebound just as previous generations have from catastrophic events. And, led by innovators whose creativity and kindness have been forged in the pandemic’s crucible, there is even a chance that we can create a better and more resilient society. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
160,"Apr 14, 2020","When the pandemic deaths are finally tallied, the number will fall far short of COVID’s real toll. Not counted will be the elders and others who are being frightened to death because of the absolutely essential measures to contain the virus’s spread. For frail seniors, self-isolation and physical distancing are causing anxiety, which leads to worsening physical and mental health. Already, seniors in long-term care and assisted living residences have given up a tremendous degree of control over their own lives or had it unwillingly taken from them. They’ve left their homes, sold or given away most of their belongings. As their bodies and minds have declined, they were unable to live independently. Now, even that new normal of increased dependency has been turned upside down. More than five weeks ago, my mother’s residence in Saskatchewan was locked down. No visitors are allowed, only staff. For more than a month, residents have been restricted to their suites or rooms as a precautionary measure, social activities cancelled or limited to five people and the dining room closed. In these residences, seniors exist in the blue, flickering gloaming of their TVs, many watching reruns of curling. “A godsend,” one staff member told me. “It keeps them from watching the news.” A godsend too is the fact that, except for the keenest of fans, most don’t realize the bonspiels have long since ended and the victors declared. Already lonely, their physical contact is limited to health care aides and non-medical staff, who deliver meals and snacks to their rooms, drop in for visits or clean their rooms. As the days tick by families and staff are, as patiently as possible, constantly having to explaining again and again why they can’t go for meals and why this virus is different from anything any of us has ever experienced. As families, we are left to parent our elderly parents and grandparents through this terrible phase by phone or by video calls for those who are able. We offer bromides and try to distract with stories of the old days because the current days provide no ready distractions. But what do you say when they ask, ‘When will this end?’ Knowing that the best estimate for a viable vaccine is at least 18 months away, what reassurance is that to someone whose foreseeable future may only be measured in months or a few years? As odd as it seems to write this, there are lucky families who can stand outside a window cellphone in hand. For the rest of us, it’s painful to have to keep answering ‘I don’t know’ to the plaintive question, ‘When are you coming to visit?’ Each time, you explain that for their safety, visiting is banned. You explain again that non-essential travel is banned. Even if visiting weren’t banned, you explain the risks of long-distance driving, airports, flights and the possibility of being ordered into 14-day isolation before being able to see them. But the worst question of all is the one with no good answer: “But if I can’t see my kids and grandchildren, what is the point of living?” Sleep is difficult for many now that the pandemic has disrupted our routines, forced us to self-isolate and socially distance. It’s bad for all of us, but it can hasten short-term memory loss in frail elders and increase their likelihood of falling. For reasons both good and bad, some of those fallen — my Mom among them — are admitted to hospital even as other seniors are being moved to long-term care as administrators brace for an influx of COVID patients by emptying beds. There, they are further estranged even from the unreality of their pandemic lives. There are no familiar faces. Nurses, aides and doctors cycle through. Privacy is limited. Added to the pain and injury that resulted in the admission, there’s even more fear that they’ll contract the virus. Because even at the best of times, hospitals are petri dishes for every virus. Now, that includes an even more deadly one. This is not to suggest that hospitals and staff there aren’t doing their best. Unlike in normal times, there’s a phone beside my mother’s hospital bed provided free. And, on Easter, the bunny hopped by and left chocolate. There is no doubt that health care workers are working hard in incredibly dangerous and stressful times. My heart goes out especially to the many whose own loved ones may live thousands of kilometres away and often in countries where the COVID response may not be as robust as Canada’s. One can’t help wonder who is caring for their elders, while they care for ours? We can only be grateful that they are willing to do it. But despite everyone’s best efforts, beloved mothers, fathers, grandparents, aunts, uncles and treasured old family friends are dying of COVID without being able to see their loved ones again, without being able to hug or kiss them and say goodbye. And, sadly, for the good of the many, many others are as well. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
161,"Apr 10, 2020","Even at the best of times, refugees arrive tired, bewildered and, often, traumatized. But in these worst of times, they are Canada’s most marginalized and most vulnerable. With no friends, no family, no English or French language skills, and little, if any, cultural knowledge, most of them are dependent on settlement societies and sponsorship groups to help them navigate their new world. Now, even that world is changing daily with emergency directives that are incomprehensible for many recent arrivals because translation is limited to a few languages and their navigators are practising physical distancing, working from home because they don’t have protective gear. Refugee settlement has been designated an essential service during the pandemic and Chris Friesen has barely slept in weeks. As director of settlement services of theImmigrant Services Society of B.C.and co-chair of the national COVID response team set up by Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada, he’s one of many trying to retool services on the fly in a very complex system. When the Canadian government and the International Organization for Migration suspended settlement operations on March 17, it left 7,500 people with permanent resident visas stranded. Of those, 3,903 are government-assisted refugees, which means they are in such urgent need of protection that some are still being brought to Canada. Last week, for example, one family and one individual arrived, one in Alberta and another in Ontario. They’re in quarantine. Government-assisted refugees include torture victims, single mothers who are victims of violence, people with special medical needs, individuals who had been jailed for spurious reasons and persecuted minorities from ethnic, cultural, religious or LGBTQ+ groups. Also in limbo are 3,697 privately sponsored refugees who are sponsored by individuals, community- and religion-based groups. Some are living in or have been forced to return to overcrowded refugee camps where the International Organization for Migration says COVID-19 could be catastrophic. There are about 26 million refugees worldwide. Others are in hotels near now-empty airports, stuck in transit centres or desperately searching for shelter having already given up accommodation in advance of their cancelled departure. Thousands of in-country refugees are also in COVID-induced limbo. “I worry most about the single mothers and those urgent protection cases whose arrival has been suspended through no fault of own,” Friesen said. A survey of 37 Canadian settlement societies completed on April 3 found permanent housing is the most pressing need for the 274 refugees currently in temporary accommodation. Among the many challenges is that most settlement workers don’t have personal protective equipment. So, with physical distancing and work-from-home directives, it’s impossible to escort clients to view rentals. Add to that, most landlords also don’t want to risk showing suites. For five agencies, which aren’t identified in the survey, it’s so difficult that they’ve simply given up trying. For now, they are struggling to keep their clients safe in temporary situations where they often share kitchens and bathrooms with others and there is nowhere for them to self-isolate. Worse, asked Friesen, what happens if single mothers become ill and have to either self-isolate or be hospitalized? In B.C., Friesen contacted the Ministry of Children and Family Development for help. It has established protocols. Fortunately, they haven’t had to be used … yet. But one unidentified agency in the survey said it has already transferred one sick child to another province and transported another to a different city. It’s hard to imagine how frantic families in a strange country are able to cope with that. Aside from accommodation, it’s very difficult to connect newcomers with doctors for non-COVID-related reasons with so many clinics closed and doctors reassigned. It’s also challenging to get the daily COVID updates and advice from governments and medical health officers translated into hundreds of different languages. But that’s only the tip of very big iceberg. The overwhelming question is how to support tens of thousands of refugees, while keeping everyone including staff and volunteers safe? Pre-COVID-19, staff and volunteers were often physically by newcomers’ sides setting up bank accounts, going to medical appointments, shopping, filling out myriad government forms and, of course, for the all-important language classes. Now, agencies are scrambling to get everything online. But that requires internet connections, data plans, smart phones, computers, applications for conferencing and translators. And for some things, it’s simply not enough. To access various governments’ emergency programs requires refugees who came last year to file income tax returns. Last week, Friesen urged the federal government to allow settlement societies to do that on behalf of marginalized families. “We may have to turn into a virtual H&R Block,” Friesen said. “All of the new benefits being rolled out to Canadians, these families can’t get them without filing income tax and how do you do that without a computer, low-digital literacy and low literacy?” Every month, there are also clients refugees transitioning from the yearlong federal support to provincial income supports. For many, that’s also impossible to navigate that without help. “This is evolving hour to hour as new issues come up,” said Friesen. “We have to remain nimble and reactive and flexible.” So what do settlement organizations need most? “We need it (the pandemic) to go away.” Later, the weary Friesen emailed with a more pragmatic answer. “If any of your readers had housing leads for any of these individuals, we would be most grateful. … A Syrian family of four, an Ethiopian family of four, three individuals from Syria and Uganda.” dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter:@bramham_daphne CORRECTION:An earlier version of this story incorrectly described Chris Friesen’s job title.

162,"Apr 05, 2020","Had Dr. Mehdi Shahsavan stayed in British Columbia, he would be sitting on the sidelines of the COVID-19 epidemic like thousands of foreign-trained doctors, writing letters and signing petitions begging for a chance to work. Instead, the Iranian-trained general practitioner and emergency room specialist is on the front lines in the Prairie town of Assiniboia (pop. 2,389). Shahsavan arrived there in September along with another Iranian-trained doctor. They were greeted by the mayor and feted at a come-and-go tea at the Town Hall after having successfully passed the Saskatchewan College of Physicians and Surgeons’ practice-ready assessment program. Even in that small town, the clinic where they work has already had a COVID case, a reminder of how pervasive the virus’s spread is that. Fortunately, the patient has fully recovered and there were doctors available. Other patients may not be so lucky. “There are many IMGs from around the world — family physicians, internal medicine specialists, surgeons and others — who have passed all of their exams, are well-trained and have worked in different provinces,” Shahsavan said from Saskatchewan. “I am totally sure that Canada would not have any health-care professional shortage if they used IMGs.” IMGs are international medical graduates. Among them are Canadians who went to medical school abroad. Still, Canada has long had at very least a mismatch of doctors and patients, if not a doctor shortage. Rural areas are severely underserved, but even in Vancouver many people struggle to find a family doctor. There are an estimated 5,000 IMG across the country Canada who have passed all the necessary Canadian exams and have years of experience and are actively trying to get licensed. At least as many more have given up on getting a licence and have found other jobs. Even in a pandemic and despite IMGs pleas to federal and provincial health ministers to let them help in some capacity, no one has responded. In British Columbia, medical students and residents are being given temporary emergency licenses as are retired physicians. IMGs aren’t eligible. After April 15, however, IMGs will be eligible to become “associate physicians” working under supervision as employees of health authorities. The college insists that this is not because of COVID or political pressure. Canada’s points-based immigration system favours professionals. Under Canada’s refugee law, not being allowed to practise the profession you are trained for is one of the grounds for making an asylum claim. But once they get here, few end up practicing because getting a licence can take up to 10 years in a system that seems rigged against them. Provincial colleges of physicians and surgeons require them to re-do their postgraduate work in hospitals. Six provinces including B.C. and Saskatchewan have practice-ready assessment programs as an alternate, faster pathway to practice. Ontario, the largest, doesn’t. But as with residencies, there are limited spots and application requirements vary. Saskatchewan, for example, doesn’t require a previous two-year residency. That means doctors like Shahsavan whose residency was only 18 months are eligible. But in British Columbia, a 24-month residency as a prerequisite. It means that the only route to licensure is doing a second residency in Canada, which is contingent on getting matched with a hospital. And that is almost impossible. Last year, only 391 of the 1,725 foreign-trained doctors who got an interview with the Canadian Resident Matching Service made it to the second round. But, there were another 977 who had passed all the exams, paid the registration fee and didn’t even get an interview. By comparison, only 31 of the 2,984 graduates from Canadian medical schools failed to get a residency. “Having foreign-trained doctors in survival-type jobs as health-care aides, delivering for Skip the Dishes or working as security guards is not utilizing their talent,” said Deidre Lake, executive director of the Alberta International Medical Graduates Association. “Surely we can do better than that.” Her organization has over 1,000 members from 82 countries. Funded by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, it helps foreign-trained doctors get their licenses. But it helps many more find alternative careers. “They come with hope …” she said from Calgary. “But when they arrive, they find the journey to licensure is timely, costly and highly competitive. Many don’t meet with success.” The same is true for many Canadians who trained abroad. “It’s a tragedy that’s probably measured in lives,” said Rosemary Pawliuk, president of the Society of Canadians Studying Medicine Abroad. In 2018, the society filed a lawsuit against the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons, the B.C. Health Ministry, UBC, the Canadian Resident Matching Service, the Health Professions Review Board and the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada. The suit was filed after the Health Professions Review Board returned the society’s appeal documents, indicating it could not hear the matter. But after the lawsuit was filed, the board advised that there had been “a clerical error” and the material should not have been returned. So, the society once again filed the information with the review board, which has yet to rule. Until it does rule, the lawsuit is in abeyance. Pawliuk said the Canadian system has “lost its moorings of legal authority” because it treats IMGs as second-class citizens. Even if they are lucky enough to get a rare match, they are only eligible for residencies in psychiatry, pediatrics, internal and family medicine. Graduates from Canadian schools (including foreign students) have a choice of nearly 70 specialties. Unlike Canadian school graduates, when IMGs do get a residency they must sign contracts agreeing to stay in that community for several years. If they leave early, they must repay the cost of the training. The pandemic highlights this tragic waste of human resources. And yet it also offers an opportunity to consider how Canada can best use the tremendous skills and experience that not only doctors but all foreign-trained professionals possess as we rebuild post-COVID dbramham@postmedia.com twitter.com/bramham_daphne CLICK HEREto report a typo.

163,"Apr 02, 2020","Dr. Hassan Moustafa is anxious to do what he can to help Canadians survive the COVID-19 crisis. He is one of thousands of international medical graduates — both immigrants and Canadians who studied abroad — who has volunteered to help in any capacity, even if he’s not paid. Like thousands of others, the offer has so far gone unanswered by governments and been rebuffed by the various Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons across the country. It is extraordinary considering daily reports that health-care workers are already feeling overburdened and exhausted. On Monday, the B.C. government said it is already preparing the Vancouver Convention Centre as a 271-bed hospital and opening 80 beds in the new tower at Royal Columbian Hospital for less acutely ill patients. Who will staff those when doctors and nurses are already stretched thin? Up until Wednesday, the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons said it would grant emergency licences. But foreign-trained doctors need not apply unless they were educated in the United States. So far, 35 licences have been issued — 19 to specialists and 16 to family practitioners. But mid-week, the college notified its members of a bylaw change that would create a new category of registrant for international medical graduates or IMGs — associate physician. Spokesperson Susan Prins emphasized that the change was first proposed in the fall and is not in response to the COVID crisis. The only thing that has changed is that Health Minister Adrian Dix has allowed the college to fast-track the notification period. But, assuming the college’s members agree, the new category of associate physician will come into effect after April 15. However, there are many caveats. One of the key ones is that this is not a stepping stone for IMGs to being able to practice independently. Associate physicians will only be registered after the college receives detailed, written requests from health authorities. Associates will pay a $340 registration fee, which is in line with what postgraduate residents en route to full licensure pay. Unlike residents, associates will be employees of the health authority and, when they are no longer needed, their registration will be revoked. The IMG talent pool is extraordinary, to say nothing of the fact that many — including Nigerian public health and infectious disease specialists who are trying to get registered in Alberta — have worked through epidemics in their own countries or under other extremely difficult conditions. Moustafa is one of them. Up until three years ago, he was a refugee in Iraq. There, he worked with Doctors Without Borders and the United Nations, first as a general surgeon and manager of the medical centre in Domiz. Built to house 1,000 refugees, the camp had about 6,000 people while he was there. It’s since grown to more than 32,000. Before fleeing Syria, Moustafa was a surgeon in Qamishli, near the Turkish border. In addition to five years of medical school, he’d did five years of surgical training in Damascus. In 2017, he and his family came to Canada, sponsored by Vancouver’s Temple Shalom. Since then, he has passed all of the necessary examinations. What he hasn’t got yet is a residency, which is essential for IMGs to become certified. Until COVID-19 struck and the University of B.C.’s Life Sciences Institute was closed, Moustafa assisted medical students in the morgue with anatomy and creating educational materials for them. “It’s a crime that I am at home in this crisis,” he said over the phone. “I want to work. It’s my job. … The United States is always asking for doctors, maybe I could go there.” But Moustafa said Thursday he is heartened by the college’s decision to allow associate physicians. An Iranian-Canadian pathologist told me that she and her hematologist husband have offered to work without pay during the pandemic in B.C. as well as Alberta. No one has taken up their offer. She didn’t want her name used because, for the third year, she is waiting to hear from the Canadian Residency Matching System whether she will get one of the precious few spots. Last year, 1,334 of the 1,725 international medical graduates who applied went unmatched, while all but 103 of the 2,984 graduates from Canadian medical schools received placements. “I don’t want to be seen as somebody complaining,” the pathologist said. “I want to help improve the system. I want people who come here to be beneficial for the community.” With each passing year, she is more frustrated. She has passed all of the same exams that Canadian medical students have, but she has much more experience. Having worked as both a general practitioner and pathologist in Iran, she came to Canada 11 years ago to do blood research as a fellow at UBC. Following that, she moved to the University of Calgary’s transfusion centre and was licensed by the college as a medical research associate. And, for seven months in the past year, she was an unpaid clinical trainee working in B.C. clinics and hospitals alongside fourth-year medical students. What’s frustrating for her and other IMGs is that when the B.C. college announced earlier this month that it would allow emergency registrations, foreign-trained doctors were not even considered. Instead, emergency registrations would only be granted to: recently retired physicians; third- and fourth-year surgery residents; this year’s medical school graduates; third-year clinical fellows; and, physicians licensed for independent practice elsewhere in Canada or the United States. In a crisis, it seems absurd to not use all of the available expertise and experience that’s available in Canada. At very least, foreign-trained doctors could help with screening and assessments. They could answer virus helplines in multiple languages, help in labs. Unless we end up with the worst-case scenario, it’s possible that they may not be needed on the front lines. But just as temporary hospitals are being readied, provinces should be preparing an emergency roster of all available trained health-care workers including those who have been trained abroad. Because even before they have been asked, they are volunteering to put themselves in harm’s way. Nearly 15,000 people have signed anonline petitionpleading with federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu to let them help. They want to use what they have learned and live up to the oath of healing that they’ve all sworn to uphold. To ignore them is like a National Hockey League team choosing to play without a goalie when the guy driving the Zamboni could competently step in. Yet in Canada, this happens every day even without a pandemic. Now, COVID threatens to overwhelm our already stretched health-care system, it only makes it more obvious. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
164,"Mar 28, 2020","Advocates for B.C. seniors say drastic new provincial measures to protect people at long-term care facilities from COVID-19 will be effective, after officials announced yet another case at one of the homes on Saturday. Dr. Bonnie Henry, the provincial health officer, said a 12th facility was experiencing an outbreak for a total of six facilities in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and six in the Fraser Health region. There have been 17 deaths in B.C. linked to COVID-19, including 11 at the Lynn Valley Care Centre, where there have been 46 cases among residents and 24 among staff. Haro Park Centre has the second-largest cluster with 30 residents and 28 staff. On March 16, Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix restricted access to long-term care homes and assisted living facilities to essential visits only, such as compassionate visits for end-of-life care and visits crucial to residents’ care and well-being. On Thursday, Henry made mandatory orderslimiting movement of staff at public and private long-term care facilitiesand requiring all operators tohand over a staff roster to the Ministry of Health. “The restriction of the visitors, the workers assigned to one site and the decision to institute outbreak protocols on one case — and that case can be either a resident or a staff member — yes, those measures will make a difference,” said Isobel Mackenzie, seniors advocate for B.C. “How much remains to be seen. It doesn’t mean we won’t see more outbreaks and it certainly doesn’t mean we won’t see spread in the facilities where there are outbreaks. But we would certainly have more without these measures.” Mackenzie said health officials have restricted visits to the facilities “in the most severe way” and were right to lower the threshold for outbreak protocols to a single case, while focusing testing on health care workers and residents at the 12 homes. At this point, officials are doing everything they can, Mackenzie said, adding they have shown no lack of concern for seniors. She pointed to Henry’s emotional moment on March 10 while announcing Canada’s first COVID-19 death at the Lynn Valley Care Centre, a man in his 80s who had underlying health conditions. “She knew, like I knew — like many of us know — what was going to happen now,” Mackenzie said. “I think that she has consistently, in almost every briefing, emphasized and talked about the elderly and seniors.” Daniel Fontaine, CEO of the B.C. Care Providers Association, said his organization has long worried about a crisis impacting long-term care facilities, and had been pushing for government to address a lack of staff and resources. But Henry’s order restricting staff to a single facility — which the association pushed for early on in the pandemic — is an important protective measure, he said. “It’s not a perfect solution because people who are working in care homes live in the community and we know there’s community spread, so someone can get it in the community and come to work,” he said. “But it will help reduce the potential for it to go from multiple sites.” He said government took too long to implement restrictions on visitors recommended by his organization but said he’s pleased Henry has put them into place. “It’s helping to support the operators to stabilize the homes so that staff can focus more on the seniors and keeping them protected, as opposed to worrying about who’s coming in and out of the front door,” Fontaine said. “As far as I’m concerned, one care home is too many to have COVID-19. “I think when we look outside the cluster that’s happened at Lynn Valley and Haro, they seem to have it under control, in terms of being able to isolate staff — when they’ve been identified (as having the disease) — and seniors as well.” neagland@postmedia.com twitter.com/nickeagland CLICK HEREto report a typo.

165,"Mar 26, 2020","In the midst of a triple crisis — COVID-19, drug-overdose deaths and homelessness — residents of Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside are highly at risk, and their inability to self-isolate puts us all at risk. This is not a condemnation. It’s a fact. Without full compliance on limiting social contact, every health official and politician is warning us that the virus could spread to the point where it swamps hospitals and leads to thousands of deaths. It’s also a fact that it’s impossible to self-isolate and practise physical distancing if you have no home to stay in. Complicating all of that is another fact. Many DTES residents are already on a self-destructive trajectory with addictions and mental-health issues. For them, as Dr. Patricia Daly of Vancouver Coastal Health said Thursday, overdose death is a greater risk than dying from COVID. Although she refused to confirm whether any residents have tested positive for the virus, Daly said people need to assume that there are COVID-positive individuals in every community. These are extraordinary times and nowhere are extraordinary measures more needed than in Canada’s most desperate neighbourhood. Canada has shut the border and ordered mandatory quarantine for all Canadians returning from abroad. B.C. on Thursday said it will issue punitive fines to people who disobey physical-distance orders and opportunists buying and reselling essential goods. Emergency powers invoked by Canada, the province and the City of Vancouver provide politicians with the ability to act in the best interests of all people when individuals can’t or won’t do it for themselves. It provides governments with “an opportunity to do a lot of right things” for DTES residents, says John Blatherwick. Now retired, he worked through the SARS epidemic and before that was one of the architects of Vancouver’s Four Pillars drug strategy that included prevention, enforcement, treatment and harm reduction. It was revolutionary and never fully implemented because there was never enough money, never enough political will to get it done. “The Downtown Eastside is one example of where we couldn’t solve it while it was not a big problem. The bent was always that we had to mitigate it,” he said. “Now, it is a big problem.” What he recommends is radical and bound to make civil libertarians a lot queasier than they already are. As quickly as possible Blatherwick would move residents out of the neighbourhood and into well-equipped shelters in parks outside the city’s core. The idea is grounded in his optimistic belief that with full compliance on handwashing, social distancing and self-isolation, Vancouver can still flatten the curve of COVID transmission and manage the infections without overwhelming the health-care system. “If we leave them where they are, we are going to have real problems if it (COVID) gets in that population because they will not socially isolate,” he said. “They don’t social isolate. That’s the problem that’s always been down there.” Rather than commandeering downtown hotels and nearby community centres as the city is doing, Blatherwick would set up camps in regional and provincial parks that are already closed. A former military man, he said the camps could be quickly erected using well-equipped tents like the ones the Canadian military used in Afghanistan. Alternately, they could be built using shipping containers as B.C. Housing has already done in Vancouver. But here’s the key part, not only would residents have safe, secure and clean accommodation, they would be surrounded by services. They would get cooked meals, rather than the grab bags being handed out in the DTES. They would have access to medical care and a full range of mental-health and addictions services, including a safe supply of drugs provided by addiction specialists. To quell fears about governments’ stomping on individuals’ rights to choose how and where they live, Blatherwick said, people who don’t have the virus could be offered the chance to try the camps out. Does Blatherwick really think there’s anyone brave enough to try it? “They won’t do anything until the crisis hits and I don’t think we’re there yet,” he said. In effect, it would be one grand experiment — a temporary chance to see whether taking people out of a dysfunctional community and offering them more and better services might give them the chance at a better life post-COVID. Yes, it may be radical and revolutionary. But so is telling every Canadian that they have to stay home, telling families they can’t visit their elderly loved ones, banning mass gatherings, shutting churches, temples and mosques, closing businesses that don’t provide essential services, shutting the border, emptying hospitals in advance of an expected COVID onslaught and banning evictions. We don’t know how all of that is going to work out either. Brave. Bold. Stupid. Revolutionary. Reactionary. Anti-democratic. Totalitarian. These days, it’s hard to even know what those labels mean against a backdrop of potentially millions of people dying from an unseen, untreatable, unpreventable enemy. Doing everything necessary to protect ourselves and the most vulnerable, including the old, ailing, homeless and addicted, means thinking — and maybe even doing — what was unthinkable before. dbramham@postmedia.com twitter:@bramham_daphne"
166,"Mar 24, 2020","Tommy Thomson isn’t feeling well. He’s coughing. His husband had pneumonia recently, but without symptoms bad enough to warrant COVID-19 testing. The couple don’t want to pass on whatever it is that they’ve got and neither wants to get the novel coronavirus. So, they’re following the health directives, self-isolating in their Burnaby apartment. But as renters whose one-year lease is up on April 30, they’re in a crazy predicament. They want to stay, but the landlord wants to sell. Last Friday, the couple was given 48 hours to make a choice: Sign an agreement to end their tenancy on April 30 and there would be no open houses and no showings; or, Don’t sign the deal and the landlord would exercise the right under the Residential Tenancy Act to have showings and open houses with notice. They didn’t sign. Like many Metro Vancouver renters, this isn’t the first time Thomson has been vulnerable to eviction. He remembers living in Little Mountain as a child, long before that rental community was sold to a developer, its residents evicted and its buildings demolished. Now the land lies mostly fallow. Thomson wrote his UBC master’s thesis on it. In 2006, Thomson and his neighbours tried to fight a Dec. 31 eviction from a New Westminster apartment building. They gave up after the owner offered them each $400 and allowed them to stay an extra month free. Then, last year after enduring a year-long renovation of their building in downtown Vancouver, Thomson and Barker were evicted after their landlord sold. This time, they hope that the major changes set to be announced today Wednesday to protect renters who may be unable to pay their rent because of COVID-related layoffs will also protect them. But that doesn’t seem likely. On Monday, Premier John Horgan promised that no renters would be forced from their homes due to circumstances related to COVID-19. But he also made it clear that there would not be a blanket ban on evictions. Evictions already in progress would follow the normal process. Finance Minister Carole James noted that she was encouraged by the goodwill shown by landlords who have suspended planned evictions. But tenants advocates and others quickly fired back that more than goodwill is needed. So far, only Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have banned evictions for differing periods of time. Of course, it’s not only renters dismayed by the notion that goodwill might enough to get us through this. There are landlords who can’t afford to carry the costs if renters aren’t able to pay. There are sellers who need to sell or face foreclosure. And, no doubt, there are investors looking at this as an opportunity. Beyond all that, there are the very practical considerations related to the various orders linked to COVID. “How are people going to find places to rent with social distancing and all the restrictions?” asks Thomson. “How would we even hire a mover? Are movers still working?” For Canadians to follow the expert advice to stay home and keep a safe distance apart, Thomson is adamant: “There needs to be a moratorium on evictions as well as open houses and showings.” Last week at the urging of its members, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver issued a “strong recommendation” to cancel all open houses and began the process of disabling the open house function on the website realtylink.org. Instead of the 600 originally planned across British Columbia on the weekend, there were only 69. Still, there were 69 open houses including some in highrise buildings where viewers potentially could have transmitted the virus to dozens of residents by touching door handles, elevator buttons and railings. Even before that, the board removed the requirement that realtors make all homes on the Multiple Listing Service available for viewing. “It’s trying for buyers, understanding that they are not able to access properties,” board chair Ashley Smith said Tuesday. “It’s tough to buy a home without seeing. But different people (have a) different appetite for buying remotely.” Few of the board’s 14,000 members quarrelled with the decisions. Most, Smith said, were grateful for some direction in how to balance their fiduciary responsibility to clients with the COVID risks and health orders of spreading the virus because some sellers quite aggressively urged their agents to push the boundaries of social distancing. “If there is any silver lining to this,” she said. “We’re fortunate that we can do live video. Fifteen years ago, it would have looked very different. Now, there are things we can try to do.” But it’s fair to say that most Canadians — for whom buying a home is the largest investment of their lives — are justifiably queasy about not being able to physically walk through and inspect the property. Even as a renter, Thomson admits he’d be hard-pressed to put down money for an apartment based only on photos and videos. Is it worth the risk of spreading the virus to allow potential buyers/renters to trot through other people’s homes, touching counters and opening doors? Would denying that opportunity have unintended economic consequences for the real estate industry, which is one of the most important underpinnings of our regional economy? These are among the myriad prickly questions that need addressing if we are to navigate a path to a new normal without making worse the already desperate problems of lack of affordable housing and homelessness. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
167,"Mar 23, 2020","It’s hard to find happiness in this time of COVID-19 with the fear coupled with the disruption of the things that comfort us most like our social connections and daily routines. We are being asked to give more of ourselves than ever before, albeit the biggest ask doesn’t require action as much as passivity. Stay home if you can for your own sake and, especially for the sake of older family members, people with underlying health issues and disabilities, who are the most vulnerable. But humans are social creatures. We worry about the economy, money and income inequality. Yet, global research indicates that when it comes to happiness, what’s more important are connections to others, a sense of belonging and pulling together for the common good. Counter-intuitively, for example, Iceland’s ranking on the World Happiness Index rose in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. On the brink of complete financial collapse, Icelanders drew strength from each other to survive it and felt better about themselves and their neighbours as a result. Faced with a global pandemic, what we’re being asked to do is pull together even as we are ordered to pull apart. “Loneliness was a huge public health problem already. And that will be vastly increased with this crisis,” says Elizabeth Dunn, a University of British Columbia psychologist and happiness researcher. Late last week, Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s public health officer acknowledged that the effects of social distancing have concerned her since the pandemic began. “It exacerbates substance use and domestic violence,” she said. “It stretches our relationships when we are together all the time especially when children are involved.” Henry said it also causes anxiety and has the potential to make other mental health issues worse. Striking a balance between the loneliness epidemic and what needs to be done to slow a viral pandemic is one reason Canada’s public health officers and politicians have been so reluctant to issue sweeping quarantine orders. But among the reasons that they have such confidence that the overwhelming people would comply without having to make enforceable orders is that Canadians have maintained a high level of trust in public institutions including their governments, another measure used to determine happiness and one on which Canadians score highly, according to the 2020 World Happiness Report released Friday. Canada ranked 11th, falling out of the top 10 for the first time in 15 years, squeezed out by Luxembourg by a mere 0.006 points. As they have perennially, Finland, Denmark and Switzerland topped the list. The United States was 18th and China was 94th. Afghanistan was last among the 153 countries. More important than the rankings is the report’s conclusion that the factors that lead to high rankings also buffer us in hard times. Citizens in societies like ours are more resilient, better able to find creative ways to face the crisis as well as rebuild. We’re more likely to help others when we’re being asked to help others by staying away as we struggle to fill our days waiting for the unseen and the unknowable. During the Syrian refugee crisis, Canadians were quick to step up. In these early days of the pandemic, there seem to be more Canadians wanting to help than people in need of it. That’s no surprise to Dunn whose research involved toddlers and Goldfish crackers. Rather than hoarding, they got more joy out of sharing — a finding replicated in other similar studies around the world including where people struggle to meet their own basic needs. “This is really a fundamental component of human nature,” she said. “Even very, very young people get a great deal of happiness from sharing. … More than they get from having more for themselves.” Of course, it doesn’t explain the hoarding that’s been one of the pandemic’s ugliest features so far. “The whole world has turned upside down,” she said. For researchers like Dunn, it’s an unprecedented research opportunity. But it’s also a time to put what she’s learned into practice. Dunn plans to support local businesses, ordering takeout from her favourite restaurants, shopping at favourite stores and participating in online yoga classes. She’s already had a virtual party with friends with more planned. Finally, she said, “I’m going to take the time to write some gratitude letters to some of the older people in my life … telling them about the influence they’ve had in my life. “They could suddenly not be around.” If none of those things work for you, figure out something else to do. Bake. Make soup. Do jigsaw puzzles. Walk. Hike. Bike. Stay home, if you can. The average person on a normal day makes 20 social contacts. Everyone who’s infected on average infects 2.2 others and some of them will die since there is no cure yet. Saving people’s lives? That should make you happy. dbramham@postmedia.com"
168,"Mar 20, 2020","A staff member at the Dufferin Care Centre in Coquitlam has tested positive for COVID-19 and is now in self-isolation. Dr. Martin Lavoie, chief medical health officer for Fraser, said enhanced control measures have been put in place and an investigation is underway. “Fraser Health is working with the facility to identify anyone who may have been exposed and taking steps to protect the health of all staff, residents and families,” Lavoie said Friday. The long-term care facility at 1131 Dufferin St. is owned by Retirement Concepts. Long-term care staff currently working at the centre will not be working at any other facilities to prevent the spread of the virus, Lavoie said. Fraser said in a news release said it will maintain staffing levels and only “essential visitors” may visit. Staff and resident movement has been restricted and cleaning and infection-control has been increased. Staff and residents will be screened twice a day for the virus. Families have been notified. “During this time, Fraser Health will have a presence on site to take any further actions required and support the facility,” Fraser said. “This includes dedicated people to address quality, communications on site to answer staff, residents and family questions, active checks of symptoms in staff and residents.” While a single case has been confirmed at Dufferin Care Centre — not an outbreak — the health authority is working to prevent the spread of COVID-19 there and at all other long-term care facilities in the region, Lavoie said. “We know that people who are older (and have) chronic medical conditions are of course at higher risk of more severe disease, and so long-term care facilities are certainly an area that we need to pay particular attention to,” he said. “We don’t have this situation in any other facility, at this point, but all across the board we’re really increasing various preventative measures to reduce the risk of introduction of the virus into the facility, or if we have the virus in a facility, very quickly identify the sick person — testing — and then going from there and implementing measures.” Measures include reducing the number of visitors, extra cleaning focused of “high-touch surfaces,” ensuring residents and staff check themselves for symptoms, and taking rapid action if someone feels ill. “We’ve implemented a whole suite of measures to prevent any outbreak in a long-term care facility, and this is above and beyond what we do normally considering the COVID-19 situation,” Lavoie said. neagland@postmedia.com twitter.com/nickeagland"
169,,"It’s 4:45 a.m. and raining. Ted VanAsseldonk is unfazed. As he does almost every morning, the 70-year-old retired firefighter starts up the Abby Grind, an Abbotsford trail that climbs the lower slopes of Taggart Peak. Despite the steep grade, he chats comfortably with fellow members of an informal hiking group that meets before dawn at the trailhead. He’s wearing a raincoat and shorts. “My legs don’t get cold,” he says. Hail begins to fall, the tiny ice pellets illuminated by his headlamp. At the bluffs that mark the end of the trail, fog obscures the view before being hurried away by a sharp wind. The Trans-Canada Highway appears below, hundreds of red tail lights rushing west two hours before sunrise. “This is the best way to start the day,” VanAsseldonk says with a broad smile. There’s time for a group selfie before the hikers start down and VanAsseldonk continues home to his wife, Helga. He needs to be back before she wakes at 7:30 a.m. In 2015, about five years after VanAsseldonk retired from a 34-year career with the Surrey Fire Department, Helga suffered a life-altering stroke. The couple, married for 44 years in August, had settled into a comfortable retirement routine — walks at Mill Lake, visits with friends and puttering in the kitchen together. But the stroke brought changes. Helga needed to use a wheelchair and was unable to speak. VanAsseldonk became his wife’s caregiver, a situation shared by about one million people in B.C. who provide unpaid home care to a loved one, according to Statistics Canada data. “Our system would collapse without them,” said B.C.’s seniors advocate, Isobel Mackenzie. Unpaid caregivers provide about three-quarters of the care for people receiving care at home in Canada. Replacing the care with paid caregivers would cost more than $25 billion a year in Canada, $3.5 billion in B.C., according to the Health Council of Canada. “We really need to recognize our reliance on these people,” said Mackenzie. In 2017, the seniors advocatesounded the alarmover caregiver burnout, reporting that31 per cent of B.C.’s caregivers were experiencing distress, the second-highest rate in Canada. “When we specifically asked them ‘How are you coping?’ One-third of caregivers said they were at their wit’s end,” she said. The finding was based on surveys with caregivers who provide care to people who receive publicly subsidized home support. It is not known how many caregivers who do not receive support are struggling. Abruptly cast in the role of caregiver, VanAsseldonk found it hard to adapt to a new way of life. He eventually realized resilient caregivers must also care for themselves. “If my story can help someone else, I’m happy to share it,” he said. Every day for three months after Helga’s stroke, VanAsseldonk went to the hospital to see her. He quickly realized he would need to care for her if she was to return home. “This was the way it was going to be,” he said. “I pictured our retirement as being finished.” Experts have found that people who identify themselves as a caregiver are better able to access support and learn the skills needed for the role. VanAsseldonk adapted his expectations, his house and his life. He made several improvements to allow Helga to live at home, then took over the household chores. He also learned to provide the physical care his wife required. But the new routine was tiring. Banking and paying bills, responsibilities Helga had managed, were “horribly difficult” and sometimes required him to use his power of attorney to obtain passwords and access accounts. “I did not think this could go on much longer before I broke down,” he said. Being a caregiver can increase a person’s risk of health problems, said Dr. Kelli Stajduhar, a professor in the University of Victoria’s school of nursing, who studies family caregiving. “In the research, we see higher rates of depression, anxiety and exhaustion,” she said. “If care demands are high and caregivers aren’t supported, they’ll often become sick themselves.” Senior caregivers, most often spouses, are particularly at risk of burnout, said Mackenzie. That can lead to both the caregiver and person being cared for entering a care facility. “What we don’t know is if some support could have allowed them to remain at home. Could we have delayed or diverted that outcome?” said Mackenzie. In her 2017 report, the seniors advocate determined the supports available to unpaid caregivers in B.C., such as adult day programs, respite and home support, were not keeping pace with the aging population. Compounding that was the increasing complexity of care needs by those receiving home support. Mackenzie said that while the government has recently increased support for adult day programs, more respite care is needed, particularly in blocks of time that allow caregivers to run errands or attend appointments, things they may not have a chance to do otherwise. Stajduhar pointed out that services are provided in a standard way that might not be helpful to some caregivers. “Home support workers can only do certain things that are in their job description,” she said. In her research, she spoke to caregivers who were being offered support for tasks such as bathing, which they were comfortable to do on their own, when what they really wanted was someone to mow the lawn. “Part of the challenge is that we’ve built a system based on traditional ideas of what a family looks like and how it operates,” she said. Both experts agreed that one of the keys to a caregiver’s health and well-being is being able to take time for themselves — whatever that looks like. Brunch with friends. A support group. A quiet hotel room and a book. For VanAsseldonk, it was time in nature. A year before Helga’s stroke, a friend had asked the retired firefighter to go for a hike on McKee Peak, a small mountain near his house. After a few hours of wandering, he was hooked. The hike was organized through Meetup, a website that allows strangers to connect to plan events and activities. He soon became one of the group’s leaders, taking people on the trails twice a week. But Helga’s stroke caused him to pull back. One morning, he was online and noticed a post by a group of people who climbed the Abby Grind at 5 a.m. The early hour suited his schedule, as it would allow him to get out and return before Helga was awake. “This group of people changed my life from give up to push on,” he said. The “Rise N Grind” group meets every morning at the trailhead, although many people only show up once or twice a week. VanAsseldonk is there six out of seven days. His enthusiasm — and fitness level — is inspiring, said his friend Marci Bulloch. “His philosophy is that everyone is welcome. … He not only says that, he puts it into action,” she said. With his daughters’ help, VanAsseldonk found several pockets of time that allowed him to continue leading group hikes on Tuesday and Fridays. In six years, he’s been to 722 Meetup events. “I needed to do something for myself, to stay active, to make sure my mind is clear,” he said. “My medicine is getting exercise.” Some of the people who join him on the trails have their own stories and struggles. Stajduhar said that, in her research, caregivers benefit from talking to other caregivers, but not necessarily in a formal setting, such as a support group. A more relaxed setting, such as a walk or hike, makes people feel comfortable. “Caregiving is a universal experience that almost all of us will have some experience with at some time in our lives, whether that’s caring for children or parents or our partners,” she said. On a recent Saturday night, Van Asseldonk arrived at the Abby Grind at 11 p.m. in the middle of a windstorm. Some friends were doing repeats of the trail in quick succession as a challenge. Through the night, he climbed and descended, again and again. He finished at 8 a.m. after completing seven grinds, one for each decade of his life. gluymes@postmedia.com twitter.com/glendaluymes Barbara MacLean likes to say that a caregiver can’t be a good caregiver if they’re “falling apart themselves.” The executive director ofFamily Caregivers of B.C.said it’s crucial for caregivers to care for themselves if they want to be able to support their loved one. She likened it to the advice given on an airplane before takeoff: “Put the oxygen mask on yourself before helping someone else.” Family Caregivers is dedicated to supporting family caregivers. The non-profit does that through a support line (1-877-520-3267) that allows people to “tell their story,” receive emotional support and get help navigating the health system, said MacLean. Family Caregivers also provides education to caregivers through webinars and workshops. Another key part of the organization’s mandate involves engaging with health care workers to recognize and support caregivers from the diagnosis of their loved one onward. “At point of care, the caregiver needs to be included,” said MacLean. Doctors are encouraged to give caregivers a referral to Family Caregivers, something MacLean called a “10-second handoff.” The referral helps caregivers realize the importance of learning about their loved one’s condition, their role as a caregiver, the practical skills required and understanding that their own well-being is as important as that of the person they’re caring for."
170,"Mar 19, 2020","It’s hard to grasp the notion that the difference between life and death on a massive scale in this pandemic depends on something as simple as people staying home and forgoing close contact with others. Social distancing saving lives? It seems absurd, which may be why I keep hearing about people blithely carrying on as if there’s no risk to themselves or to others. With country after country after country closing borders, schools, restaurants, bars and advising people to work from home if possible, we’re long past any notion that this is a hoax. It’s true that there is much that remains unknown. It’s also true that mistakes will be made as experts and politicians rush to keep up. The delay in closing the Canada-U.S. border may well have been one of those. For now, we’re still at the stage where suppressing the spread of COVID-19 — keeping the number of infections as low as possible for as long as possible by social distancing, along with the closure of schools, bars and restaurants — could halve the number of COVID-19 deaths and cut peak demand for critical care by two-thirds. Even with those sharp reductions, our troubles will still be far from over. There is likely to be an eight-fold increase in the demand for critical care beds beyond available capacity, based on modelling done by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team using data from China and South Korea. Thestudyreleased earlier this week laid out scenarios for Britain and the United States. No one has yet predicted how many Canadians might die. But the modelling suggests that half of all those needing critical care will. Using expert clinical opinion, the Imperial College team estimated the infection fatality rate for those over 80 at 9.3 per cent. The rate drops to 5.1 per cent for people aged 70 to 79, and 2.2 per cent for those 60 to 69, declining to 0.002 per cent for children under nine. As absurdly simple as it seems to suppress a pandemic by staying on the couch, it is still economically devastating. Canadians got a glimpse of its cost on Wednesday. Phase One of the federal government’s response is $52 billion — three per cent of our gross domestic product — to mitigate the damage caused by extraordinary job losses and business closures. That $52 billion only covers four months. Wrestling this virus to something approaching manageable is going to take much longer and is dependent on finding a vaccine, which could take up to 18 months. It is also yet to be determined whether anyone who has had the infection will have immunity when the next wave of the virus hits. For those who resent any restrictions placed on their freedom, these are difficult times. For those who thrive on social contact, it’s hard to accept your friends declining invitations as being in your best interest as well as their own. It’s distressing to all but the most introverted of introverts to witness the life being sucked out of our neighbourhoods as restaurants, cafes, gyms, yoga and Pilates studios, hairdressers, theatres, music venues, museums, libraries are shuttered. For those of us who live in condos and apartment buildings, it’s hard to know where social distance begins and ends. Do you share the elevator? Or wait? Those, of course, are problems that pale next to the difficulties faced by women living in abusive situations, the homeless and the poor who rely on public spaces for warmth, bathrooms, and even food. We’re learning what this new normal looks like with the hope that we may get a reprieve in the summer if the spread of infection subsides, before it is expected to rage back to life in the fall and we will be asked once again to make a few sacrifices for the greater good. But this is marathon, not a sprint. It may test the degree to which we are willing to sacrifice for the greater good. On Monday, civil libertarians warned not to overstep Canadians’ rights and freedoms in response to the prime minister’s statement that the government would be looking at the Emergencies Act to see whether amendments were needed to “enable us to take the actions needed to protect people.” On Wednesday, the B.C. government joined other provinces in declaring a state of emergency in addition to the previously declared public health emergency. It now has wide powers to enforce a wide range of orders, including its use of private property, entry without warrant, quarantines and rationing of food, fuel, medical equipment or other essential services. So far, we’ve only been asked to be our best selves, good citizens and neighbours. Most Canadians have responded as expected, with kindness and care, even in long grocery lineups. But the opportunity to suppress this pandemic is rapidly closing and we’ve been put on notice that we can do this the easier way. We can wash our hands, keep our distance and stay home. Or we can do it the harder way, with more sickness, more deaths, and police officers pulled away from more pressing duties to enforce those orders. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
171,"Mar 16, 2020","My 91-year-old mother is now in isolation as the COVID-19 pandemic rampages around the globe and increasing concern about its spread in Canada. More than empty grocery shelves, not being able to visit Mom brings home what pandemic means. Fortunately, she is not ill. Fortunately, she is fully aware of why this is necessary. Both of us have nothing but gratitude that, out of concern and caution, her senior’s residence is now closed to visitors. She is being well looked after. Still it’s disconcerting that I cannot see her, hug her and reassure her — or more likely have her reassure me — that this too shall pass. But when this will pass and what the world will be like in its aftermath are the questions driving our fears. And, with each passing day, it’s harder not be fearful as Canada’s infection arc is on the steep, epidemic climb. Stricter measures were introduced Monday. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Canadians abroad that it’s time to come home and, literally, stay at home, self-isolating for 14 days and following that with the social distancing measures that the rest of us are supposed to be practising. He appealed to Canadians’ sense of duty to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our community and to pull together. Trudeau also told almost everyone else to stay away — everyone, that is, except Americans whose infection trajectory has taken off because of its delayed responses, confused messaging and outright lies. The American exception, the prime minister said, recognizes the two countries’ integration. Trudeau didn’t rule out closing the border to all but essential transportation of goods and services. But not yet, he said, noting that he’s spoken to U.S. President Donald Trump several times over the past few days and that officials are in close contact. It’s not an exaggeration to say that it has left B.C. officials seething. B.C. Premier John Horgan had urged Ottawa to shut down the border to all but essential transportation of goods and services. “It is our strong view that visitors from the United States should not come to Canada,” B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said at the daily coronavirus briefing Monday. But if Americans simply can’t live without seeing Butchart Gardens, he said, they’re welcome to come, self-isolate and then see them on Day 15. Unlike the administrators at Mom’s assisted living residence, Premier John Horgan can’t shut the doors. And so far, he, Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry haven’t been able to convince their federal counterparts to take that drastic step. It’s one that the European Union is contemplating — a 30-day ban on all non-essential travel — after member states including Italy, Spain, Germany and France have placed their own restrictions on travel. Perhaps the urgency isn’t felt in Ottawa despite the prime minister’s own self-isolation following his wife’s positive test for the coronavirus. But here, British Columbia (pop. 5.1 million) has already spent nine weeks attempting to limit the damage with testing, social distancing and even daily briefings in the belief that knowledge is the best antidote to fear. Nine weeks in, there are 103 cases and only four deaths. In stark contrast, the province’s southern neighbour is the epicentre of the American epidemic. Washington (pop. 7.5 million) has 904 confirmed cases, 48 deaths and numerous cases of community transmission with 135 new cases reported between Sunday and Monday afternoon. Separating us from them is Canada’s second busiest border crossing. And uniting us with them is the world’s second largest trade relationship. Every day, nearly $2-billion worth of goods and services cross the Canada-U.S. border. We sell more to them than we buy and 75 per cent of everything we export goes there. But everyone who’s been to a grocery store in the past few days knows exactly how much we depend on them especially for fresh produce at this time of year. I’ll leave for another day the issue of how vulnerable we’ve allowed ourselves to become when it comes to food production and processing and how captive we are to just-in-time manufacturing. Buffeted by fear of the many unknowns, even sneezing, sneezing, sneezing into my elbow as a minor allergy flares causes me to wonder. … Could it be? When the Safeway sign warning that customers are limited to one toilet paper purchase a day made me want to buy some. Just in case. There’s only one certainty, the experts tells us each day. If you don’t come into contact with the virus, you won’t get it and you won’t pass it on. Like most people, I need to work through this pandemic even if it’s at a distance, holed up at home. I need money to keep a roof over my head and enough food and toilet paper in the cupboard to get by. I want some certainty that if I look hard enough, I’ll eventually find what I need. And I’m also doing what I can to keep myself and others safe. If it were simple, I’d gladly slam shut the gates and lock us all in until this is over. But it were that simple, the drawbridge would already be up. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
172,"Feb 29, 2020","A Chilliwack woman is questioning a Fraser Health protocol that requires her to lock up two dogs when home health support workers visit. Two years ago, Cathy Currie’s 78-year-old mother moved in with her after being diagnosed with dementia. Gail Cross has owned dogs for much of her life, and Currie’s two dogs became her close companions, sleeping on her bed and accompanying her on walks around her new neighbourhood. Cross receives two hours of respite care twice each week when a Fraser Health worker spends time with her. The family’s terriers, Buddy and Scooter, have never been a problem, and the workers often join Cross as she walks and visits with the dogs, said Currie. But the family was surprised when they received a message from Fraser Health two weeks ago telling them Buddy and Scooter must be locked up or behind a closed door when workers visit. “My dogs don’t understand. They have the run of their home. Someone can’t walk into our home and tell us to put them in a cage,” said Currie. She said the two dogs can be noisy, but they are gentle. She has no concerns about letting her seven-year-old granddaughter play with them. But a Fraser Health spokesperson said the health authority must comply with WorkSafeBC regulations regarding workplace safety. This includes identification and assessment of hazards, such as animals. “While pets can be at home during times of care, we ask that they be in a separate room as to ensure the safety of staff and their ability to provide quality care,” said the spokesperson. Currie said her mother was visibly upset by the Fraser Health directive and no longer wants the workers to visit, which makes it difficult for her family. “I think (Fraser Health) should be looking at this with care and compassion,” she said. “It’s been proven that animals help the elderly and make them happier. To take that away is not fair.” Currie said she’s been told the person who comes to help her mother on Tuesday won’t require her to lock up the dogs — “she’s fine with them.” But she remains concerned about the person who comes on Thursday, as well as other people with pets. “What about everyone else impacted by this?” she said. Fraser Health said it is committed to working with clients to find a solution that works for them and also ensures staff members are safe. “If the family remains concerned, it is best for them to speak with their case manager,” said the spokesperson. gluymes@postmedia.com twitter.com/glendaluymes CLICK HEREto report a typo.

173,"Feb 27, 2020","When his boss at the CBC first brought up the idea of aging as a topic forThe Nature of Things, hostDavid Suzukiwas interested but not sold on the concept. The plan presented to the scientist and environmentalist was about how science was going to make us all live way, way longer than the average 84 years for women and 80 years for men. “I looked at the proposal. And it was a typical thing. You know, science is discovering ways of getting fruit flies to live 50 per cent longer, and they’re doing all of these fancy DNA things, and maybe scientists are gonna extend life by 70 or 80 years. And I said, ‘This is such bull—t,’ ” the 83-year-old Suzuki, co-founder of theDavid Suzuki Foundation, said over the phone from his Vancouver office. Suzuki explained that humans have evolved to live a certain amount of time and we’ve pushed that mark a bit through science. In the end, though, for him, it comes down to quality not quantity. “We’re living longer, but you know, after the age of 65 or 70, things are not that great,” added Suzuki. “Who wants another 60 years of a sh—y life? I am much more interested in how do we age well.” So that’s what the new Nature of Things’ episode Aging Well Suzuki Style is all about. The show, which is one of the handful of episodes Suzuki hosts each season, airs on Feb. 28 on CBC-TV at 9 p.m. and streams on CBC Gem. The show offers a fascinating and very personal take on getting old. And it’s not surprising that Suzuki, for the most part, does well on the tests. “I’ve got the tears of a 20-year-old,” the famed scientist and environmentalist said with a laugh. Another key strength for Suzuki was he had pretty good balance, a major key to aging well and avoiding injury. He credits an early physical lifestyle of farm and construction work as a basis for his strong senior shape. He still rides his bike regularly, works out and walks whenever he can. While his early life consisted of physical work, all that went out the window when he turned to a life of science. It took a bit of insecurity to motivate him to take better care of himself. “When I got into the lab, I was sitting, looking through a microscope for hours and I developed a pot (belly) when I married Tara (Cullis). I was quite chubby,” said Suzuki, who admits his younger wife made him take stock. “Here I am, this guy with a big pot. S–t, I better get into some kind of shape. I mean she’s a lot younger than me. So, I started working out. And that was, to me, really lucky. I was doing it for the wrong reasons. I’m doing it to try to stay up to my wife, but I was doing it.” Suzuki points to the well-worn mantra of exercise being a key to a healthy, longer life. But he also quickly points out that humans seem to be fighting that basic idea at every turn. “The way we’ve constructed society is to go to the opposite end everything is for convenience. Right? So rather than walking up a flight of stairs, there is an escalator. Or, you know, the car services,” said Suzuki. Maintaining a healthy diet and healthy relationships also help in the quality-of-life department. “People have to have motivation. They have to have a place in society or something they do with other people, whether it’s going to karate lessons or, you know, those sorts of things that give you a sense that you still have value in society,” said Suzuki. “For me, it’s being a grandfather. This is the most joyful and … most important time in my life because I’ve got these grandchildren (he has nine in total, three in their 20s and six younger ones).” Your later years will also be improved by doing something meaningful, something that could be of value to the rest of society, he says. For Suzuki, that social currency comes in the form of activism, writing books, speeches and, of course, his TV gig. “Well, you know, the Nature of Things, I think that is a huge part of keeping me engaged because I’m very proud of this series,” said Suzuki, who has become a household name over the course of his four decades of TV science. “I’m very proud to be part of it. And, you know, it’s a joy. It keeps me learning. Every show is a learning experience for me. “But, you know, I’m not immortal. I’m going to kick the bucket — and I hope the show goes on.” And he hopes it goes on with his daughters Severn and Sarika Cullis-Suzuki. For the record, Sarika has already co-hosted a few shows with her dad and hosted a couple of her own Nature of Things as well. While the show and his family keeps him motivated to stay healthy, he admits that it’s hard to stay happy as he watches more pipelines getting green-lit and trolls attacking a teen activist. However, this foreboding sense is not new for Suzuki. Sarika, in an earlier interview with Postmedia News, said her dad was often Dr. Doom and Gloom. When told about that moniker he laughed, but then turned serious. “Periodically I go through depression, despair,” said Suzuki. “Fortunately, and my wife is the same, we don’t go into despair at the same time, so we can pull each other out of that.” In the end, though, he says those feelings subside, for a bit, and he is reminded — and likes to remind others — that giving up isn’t an option and that, by joining forces, change can happen. He sticks a pin in that point with this story: “Do you know the famous story of the hummingbird and the forest fire? It’s an Indigenous story. A hummingbird is flying through the woods and suddenly sees this huge forest fire. So, he whips over to a lake, picks up a beak full of water. It goes back and drops it on the fire, and he’s whizzing back and forth this way, and all the other animals in the forest are laughing at him and saying: ‘What the hell are you doing?’ And the hummingbird looks at them and says: ‘I’m doing the best I can.’ “We’re all those hummingbirds. If there are enough hummingbirds, damn it, we can put the fire out.” A good way to become a hummingbird is to just take time to be in and part of the natural world — a concept Suzuki has long since championed in his bid to get people interested in protecting our tenuous ecosystems. He says he is always surprised by how little people pay attention to the world around them. Whether they’re riding a bus or running. “I was with my grandson Ryo. We were on a path in Victoria and I spot an owl. It was a huge owl. Maybe people are used to seeing owls but I haven’t seen many wild owls. I run over with the buggy and I’m, ‘Look, Ryo, look.’ I am taking pictures and not one person stopped to look where I was looking or said, ‘What are you doing?,’ ” said Suzuki. “So they are all doing their thing running and biking, but they’re not interested in what’s going on. And, you know, the brain is a novelty-seeking device. That bird is a really exciting part of my environment, but people are shut down.” ‘Shut down’ they must be. After all, who wouldn’t want to stop when they see one of Canada’s most recognizable figures standing on a path excitedly pointing at a tree? “Walking outside people don’t notice who I am,” said Suzuki. “It’s just an old man with a kid.” No, not really. dgee@postmedia.com twitter.com/dana_gee"
174,"Feb 05, 2020","A report looking into public funding of long-term care homes was criticized Wednesday for not consulting with the industry group representing non-governmental providers of long-term care. Daniel Fontaine, chief operating officer of theB.C. Care Providers Association, questioned theOffice of the Seniors Advocatefor not consulting with his association, which has more than 350 member organizations delivering long-term care, home health and assisted living in B.C. “I think when you ask the average British Columbian, they would find that a bit odd,” he said. “It hasn’t happened once, it hasn’t happened twice. It’s a continual pattern.” On Tuesday, the OSA releasedA Billion Reasons to Care: A Funding Review of Contracted Long-Term Care in B.C.The review said it was based on contracts, audited financial statements and expense reports. The report said there are more than 27,000 seniors living in 293 publicly funded long-term care homes; 182, or 62 per cent, are operated by private-sector contractors and not-for-profit societies. Contracted long-term care costs taxpayers $1.3 billion a year. “For the most part, those who operate care homes in B.C. — whether they are health authorities, for-profit companies or not-for-profit societies — want to provide the best possible experience for their residents,” Isobel Mackenzie, the seniors advocate, says in the report. “However, it must be acknowledged that, for many operators, the long-term care home is also a business. For-profit care homes, by the nature of their business, expect to demonstrate a profit/surplus; this underlying fact sets in motion incentives that may, at times, conflict with the best interests of the resident.” Fontaine said when he read his copy of the report, he thought pages were missing because of what he described as the complete absence of any “analysis of government-owned and operated care homes” which account for 33 per cent of care homes in B.C. He said if the report had taken a more balanced look at all the providers in the long-term care sector, it would have more credibility. Fontaine said the Office of the Seniors Advocate would carry more weight if it didn’t report to the Ministry of Health and instead reported to the legislature like the Office of the Ombudsperson and Representative for Children and Youth. He pointed to statistics on wages. The report said care aides in for-profit homes earn up to $16.85 an hour or $6.63 an hour less than the standard wage of $23.48. Fontaine said the industry standard on which the figure is based is the master collective agreement negotiated by the Hospital Employees Union, which represents about 20,000 workers in long-term care. “I take issue with that,” he said. “I don’t think that is the industry standard.” Fontaine said the industry standard should beWorkBC, which pegs the median salary for care aides at $21 an hour and not $23.48, which he called “more like the gold standard.” “We’ve been telling the minister, the ministry and the seniors advocate to work with us. You don’t have to make this into a battle every time you issue a report. This is not an us and them,” he said. “There are ways to work at this and improve health outcomes for seniors.” He said everyone at B.C. Care Providers Association welcomed the recognition by the seniors advocate that there’s a huge labour shortage in B.C. that amounts to a crisis in providing front-line care for seniors. “We support and were pleased to see that in this report.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

175,,"Some corporate-owned, long-term care homes in B.C. are getting money for nothing, while not-for-profits may be getting less than they need for their services to be sustainable. But the bottom line is that the losers are both vulnerable seniors and taxpayers who are footing the $1.3-billion annual bill. To be clear, it may be unconscionable, but for-profit operators who run a third of all the long-term homes and beds in B.C. are not breaking any rules. Just as it’s fair to assume that not-for-profits, who account for another third of the total, aren’t deliberately leaving money on the table. The problem is that the system is broken. Patients and their families have been complaining for years. On Tuesday, B.C. Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie clearly set out the evidence in her report,A Billion Reasons to Care, which comes within a few months of Island Health taking over three privately operated homes. Mackenzie’s funding review is a scorching indictment of the government’s failure to properly manage one of the largest contracting relationships it has with service providers. To some extent, Mackenzie said, the government is handing long-term care operators blank cheques. She said the rules haven’t kept pace with the fundamental shift in government procurement policy that began 20 years ago when long-term care was contracted out to private operators who were then allowed to opt out of the Health Employers Association of B.C., which once bargained on behalf of all publicly funded, health-care employers. Rules are non-existent, vague or not uniformly applied. Direct care hours, for example, aren’t necessarily separated out from the hours that care aides spend on food service or housekeeping. Financial monitoring is scant with no requirement for detailed or audited reports. In 2017-18, for-profit operators failed to deliver 207,000 hours of care for which the B.C. government paid them. Were they fined? No. They got to keep the money. Meantime, not-for-profit operators delivered 80,000 hours of care more than they were contracted to provide. Those extra hours were paid for either by lower costs in another area or by other funding sources. It is true that all operators face a staffing crisis that Mackenzie describes as being of epidemic proportions, with nearly 90 per cent of care homes not able to meet minimum staffing guidelines. But it’s partially self-inflicted. For-profit operators’ wage costs for each hour of direct care is lower across all classifications than the costs at not-for-profits and the homes run directly by health authorities. Some for-profits are paying care aides, who provide two-thirds of the care, nearly a third less than the industry standard, which works out to $6.63 an hour. Part of the difference is that for-profit operators are more likely to hire part-time rather than full-time workers, which eliminates the need to pay benefits. Raise the salaries, says Mackenzie, and workers will follow the money. The government and health authorities should also follow the money. Rather than setting a minimum wage or requiring that all operators pay the industry standard, Mackenzie says to simply end the incentive to not deliver the care. If operators didn’t deliver 207,000 hours of care, they should have been required to give that money back. But there are no penalties in any of the contracts. Don’t deliver and, ka-ching!, the bottom line suddenly looks a lot better as taxpayers’ money transforms into shareholder profits. Disturbingly, Mackenzie found that contracts varied both between and within health authorities. “All spoke to delivery of care,” she said Tuesday. “But none specified the type of care. None outlined any legal requirements to provide the care. And none had explicit penalties for non-compliance.” Every health authority also had different reporting systems. Different ones allowed expenses to be claimed differently. There were also anomalies between the profit and non-profit operators, including for-profits having surpluses 12 times higher and profits three times higher. The health authorities allowed for-profit operators to claim building expenses at 20 per cent of their revenues compared to the not-for-profits’ nine per cent. They also allowed mortgage interest rates considerably higher than market rates, double the depreciation rates, unexplained lump-sum payments to contractors working for affiliated companies, unspecified management fees in addition to administrative expenses that are higher than non-profits. One concern Mackenzie has about non-profits claiming lower building expenses is that they will not be able to upgrade their facilities as they age, meet any new accessibility requirements that may be required, or expand to meet the tsunami of demand from an aging population. It all needs to change and change quickly before even more public money is funnelled into corporate profits at the expense of vulnerable seniors who aren’t getting the care they need and deserve. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
176,"Jan 30, 2020","Twenty years from now, a 60-year-old might be able to buy a drug that will extend healthy life by a decade or two. The treatment might be taken over a period of six weeks or so. The end result? A boost to the immune system and protection against a host of age-related diseases, including heart disease, cancer and dementia. This kind of intervention wouldn’t be the fountain of youth — it won’t turn back the clock and make that 60-year-old a 16-year-old again. It wouldn’t offer eternal life. But it would produce an extended “healthspan” — extra years spent free of chronic age-related disease and disability. At least, this is one version of the near future. Some, like gerobiologist Matt Kaeberlein, believe that an extended healthspan is a likely near-future scenario — and policy makers, governments and the medical profession should be prepared for it. It has been done with animals like worms, fruit flies and mice. There have even been some promising early results using a drug called rapamycin in a study involving pet dogs. Whether or not it will actually happen with people is still debatable. But the idea and repercussions around it are real enough to warrant an entire issue of the journal Public Policy & Aging Report, which asked the question: Is aging a disease? Kaeberlein, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the biological mechanisms of aging, is asking for nothing less than a paradigm shift in the medical approach to the diseases associated with aging. He thinks it’s reasonable to expect there will be products on the market within the next 20 years that could extend healthy life, although it will take a runway of several decades to prove it works. “This is a much more effective approach toward health than the traditional medical approach of waiting until people are sick and trying to cure their disease.” As it stands, physicians treat individual diseases. The risks for a number of diseases, including many types of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease, increase with age. The biggest risk factor in heart disease, for example, isn’t smoking, too many cheeseburgers or some other environmental cause. It’s age. One estimate suggests that curing cancer or heart disease would increase life expectancy for only three or four years and curing both cancer and heart disease would increase life expectancy by less than 10 years because the risk of other kinds of diseases continue to increase exponentially. If aging could be slowed down, then life expectancy could be increased by two or three decades. “Modern medicine has gotten pretty good at keeping sick people alive, but we are not very good at curing age-related disease,” said Kaeberlein. “By treating one disease at a time, we haven’t done anything to prevent all of the other age-related functional declines from happening in that person.” By holding back aging, it is possible to hold back not just one disease, but a whole bunch of them. Age-related chronic diseases are taking an increasing toll on the world economy. One 2017 analysis estimated that half of the global health burden among adults can be attributed to age-related diseases. “I think you can make an argument that the extended period of time many older people live with multiple comorbidities currently is likely a direct result of the traditional medical approach of treating individual diseases, rather than treating biological aging.” Others are skeptical that an effective intervention to modify aging is just around the corner. “I know of no current intervention I would be willing to place a bet on,” said Douglas Gray, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and professor of biochemistry, microbiology and immunology at the University of Ottawa. “The motivations are genuine and admirable. I just don’t buy it.” Researcher Jane Rylett, whose lab at Western University investigates the mechanisms regulating chemical communication in the nervous system, doesn’t believe there is a single silver bullet for aging. What might work is a combination of approaches, she said. “Never say never. But I don’t see anything on the horizon that would signal something imminent that would allow us to prolong life for, say, 20 years,” said Rylett, who is the scientific director for the Institute of Aging at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. “Even if there was a drug targeted at aging, it would affect different people in different ways.” There are few hurdles to be overcome. One is research funding that recognizes biological aging as a risk factor in a disease. While biological aging accounts for more than 90 per cent of the risk of developing Alzheimer’s, for example, only a fraction of one per cent of the Alzheimer’s research dollars spent in the U.S. is allocated to research on the role of aging in developing Alzheimer’s. To turn the tide on the disease, more resources need to be spent on understanding how aging works, Kaeberlein argues. The other major hurdle is regulatory. Drugs approved by the FDA are approved for an “indication” — that is, the drug treats a named disease. Most of the promising work on aging so far has been with animals, and not very complex animals at that. Translating these findings to people means clinical trials. Some contend that aging has to be recognized as a disease so it can be targeted by a drug aimed at treating it. It’s worth noting, however, that some drugs have long been approved to prevent diseases. Vaccines are an example. Kaeberlein doesn’t think we should be trying to gain acceptance for the idea that aging is a disease. That’s a semantic argument that distracts from the more important conversation, he said. “What’s more important is to get people to understand that biological aging is a modifiable process.” For some, the idea that aging is a disease is absurd and potentially dangerous. “The thing that excludes aging from being a disease is its universality,” said Gray. Some animals may live extraordinarily long lives. The naked mole rat, a hairless burrowing rodent native to East Africa which can live more than 30 years — at least 10 times the lifespan for a mouse — is of great interest to scientists. The hydra, a tiny freshwater polyp, may live virtually forever. There is also great scientific interest in the outer limits of longevity for humans. There have been numerous documented cases of people living over the age of 110. But all humans age and eventually die. In 1825, the English actuary Benjamin Gompertz determined that the likelihood of dying doubled every eight years from the age of about 30. Two hundred years later, even though people live longer, his mathematical model, known as the “Gompertz curve,” still holds. It just distributes death over a longer arc, said Gray. “There is a genuine problem with ageism in our society, and the last thing we need is for older people to be perceived as diseased,” he said. “The very word invokes an entirely inappropriate response — at least that is my perception. Perhaps it is because to many people the word brings to mind the Spanish Flu or the Black Death, not a universal, passive, and gradual loss of function.” Geriatrician Dr. Peter Boling agrees. If aging is a disease, simply by staying alive, we are all sick, he said. While we can and should improve aging by tackling the impact of age-related health problems, aging is inevitable and should be considered a fact of life, not a disease. It’s better to work on preventative measures that will result in healthier people, and better care for those who are sick, said Boling, who is also a professor of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University. “The presumption is that the quality of life among older individuals is not good,” he said. “It’s an interesting mix of things when we get older. I’m more and more aware of some of the things I can’t do. I have arthritis. I know changes are taking place in my cardiovascular system. But these things are predestined. I want to say I’m glad for the things I have seen and the experiences I have had. Accumulated experience is part of the aging process.” Advocating for more basic research funding to learn about the biological causes of aging is a legitimate scientific objective. It will help us understand what makes us tick and may then lead to better health. But it will likely not ultimately uncover a fountain of youth, Boling argues. He is cautious about the idea of taking drugs with possible side effects, or editing genes to change the aging process. You might, for example, be able to boost the immune system and increase resistance to illnesses such as influenza and shingles, he said. But there might be downstream effects. Aging is a complex process and humans are complex organisms. “When you change things in a large system, you don’t know what else may occur,” Boling warns. Increasing healthspans could save governments mountains of money. One 2013 study estimated that extending a healthy life by only 2.2 years would save the U.S. $7.1 trillion in health-care costs and increased productivity, for example. But a world where 80 is the new 60 also brings up a lot of questions. Would treatments that extend life be available to everyone, or would this open a new rift between haves and have-nots? Would two more decades of life mean postponing retirement and spending two more decades in the workforce? “Obviously, there are several policy and social implications associated with an increase in healthy lifespan of 20 to 30 years. Retirement age and social security would need to be redefined, for example,” said Kaeberlein. He is doubtful it would happen all at once, and it will most likely be a gradual application of new discoveries. “There are also questions about access and who will benefit first from such discoveries and how long it will take for them to become widely available — which can’t be answered right now.” Kaeberlein would like to see Food And Drug Administration approval of an intervention to target biological aging. “This could take many forms. For example, approval of a drug that when given to healthy people acts as a preventative for several age-related diseases or indications.” Researcher Jane Rylett recently returned from a trip to Japan, the world’s first “super-aged” country, defined as one in which more than one in fivepeople are 65 or older.Canada will be a super-aged country in 10 to 15 years. The World Health Organization predicts that by 2050, there will be several dozen countries in that category, she said. “Let’s say there was something on the horizon. Let’s say there’s a great discovery,” she said. “There are a lot of health policy questions that would have to be answered. What does it mean for society if people live longer?” jlaucius@postmedia.com"
177,"Jan 29, 2020","(Reuters Health) – Elderly people with diets rich in flavonols – a group of antioxidants found in fruits, vegetables, and tea – may be less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease, a new study suggests. Researchers followed 921 people without dementia for about six years, starting when they 81 years old, on average. During the study, 220 people were diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s disease. People who had the most flavonols in their diet were about half as likely to develop Alzheimer’s than those who consumed the least, the study found. “Eat your fruits and vegetables, particularly dark leafy greens, and drink some tea every now and again,” said lead study author Dr. Thomas Holland of Rush University in Chicago. “A healthy diet that contains various fruits and vegetables is critical for continued health, especially brain health,” Holland said by email. Flavonols are a type of flavonoid, phytochemicals found in plant pigments that are known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, researchers write in Neurology. While some previous research has linked flavonoids in general to a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease, less is known about the impact of flavonols specifically. For the current study, researchers asked participants to complete annual questionnaires detailing how often they ate certain foods. They also did cognitive tests and other assessments each year to determine if participants had developed Alzheimer’s disease. The study team used the dietary information to tally each person’s total average consumption of four flavonols in particular: kaempferol, which is found in kale, beans, tea, spinach and broccoli; quercetin, in tomatoes, kale, apples and tea; myricetin, also in tea, as well as wine, kale, oranges and tomatoes; and isorhamnetin, in pears, olive oil, wine and tomato sauce. People in the study who had the lowest total amount of flavonols in their diets consumed an average of about 5.3 milligrams a day, compared with 15.3 milligrams for people with the highest flavonol consumption. While 15% of people who ate the most flavonol developed Alzheimer’s disease, this rose to 54% among those who consumed the least. This difference remained even after researchers accounted for other risk factors for Alzheimer’s like diabetes, a prior heart attack or stroke, or high blood pressure. Overall, people with the highest flavonol consumption were 48% less likely than those with the lowest to develop Alzheimer’s disease during the study period. In addition, when researchers looked at the four different types of flavonols, they found that the highest intakes of either isorhamnetin or myricetin were tied to 38% lower odds of developing Alzheimer’s, while the highest consumption of kaempferol was tied to a 51% lower risk. Quercetin intake, however, didn’t appear tied to Alzheimer’s risk. The study wasn’t designed to prove whether or how different foods might impact the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Still, the results add to evidence suggesting that flavonols might be one way people can try to minimize their risk, said Dr. Glen Finney, director of the Geisinger Memory and Cognition Program in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. “Eating a healthy and diverse diet along with good socialization, physical exercise and keeping mentally active are important for brain health and can make a difference,” Finney, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Keeping normal blood sugar levels and blood pressure on the low end of normal range are also important for brain health,” Finney added. “While dementia is an increasing risk as we age, it isn’t inevitable and there are things people can do to reduce their risk.” SOURCE: https://bit.ly/2GBkScJ Neurology, online January 29, 2020."
178,"Jan 22, 2020","WASHINGTON — Marie Antoinette’s hair turned white overnight, according to folklore, before she was executed by guillotine in 1793 during the French Revolution. The ill-fated queen embodied an extreme example of the phenomenon of stress-induced graying of the hair. The biological mechanism behind such graying had long remained a mystery. But researchers said on Wednesday they have figured out how it happens: it is driven by the body’s “fight-or-flight” response to danger. The researchers used mouse experiments to look at how stress affects the stem cells in hair follicles that are responsible for making melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells that give hair its color – black, brown, blonde, red or somewhere in between. People generally have around 100,000 hair follicles on their scalp. The researchers initially suspected that an stress-induced immune attack might be targeting the melanocyte stem cells, but that hypothesis did not pan out. They then explored whether the hormone cortisol, elevated under stress, might be the culprit, but also was a dead end. Instead they found that the body’s sympathetic nervous system, which governs the mammalian “fight-or-flight” response to danger, played a central role. It comprises a network of nerves that go everywhere including the skin, in which they are like ribbons wrapping around each hair follicle and are very close to the melanocyte stem cells. When mice were subjected to short-term pain or placed in stressful laboratory conditions, these nerves released the chemical norepinephrine, which was then taken up by the stem cells in the hair follicle that serve as a finite reservoir of melanocytes. “Normally, when hair regenerates, some of these stem cells convert into pigment-producing cells that color the hair. But when they are exposed to norepinephrine from the sympathetic nerve, all of the stem cells are activated and convert into pigment-producing cells,” said Ya-Chieh Hsu, associate professor of stem cell and regenerative biology at Harvard University and a Harvard Stem Cell Institute principal investigator. “That means there are none left. In just a few days, the reservoir of pigment-regenerating stem cells is depleted. And once they’re gone, you can’t regenerate pigment anymore,” added Hsu, senior author of the research published in the journal Nature. Hair graying is one of the many ways that stress exacts a toll on the body. The findings could guide development of treatments for stress-related graying, or potentially other stress-related changes in tissues, though this could take years, she said. Stress is not the only reason hair can turn gray. The natural aging process is the leading cause. Genetic mutations and in some cases immune attacks also can contribute to hair losing its color. “Melanocyte stem cells are also lost during aging,” Hsu said. “An interesting hypothesis could be that stress is an accelerated aging process. But we don’t know if that is true yet. We are interested in finding out the link.” (Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Sandra Maler)"
179,"Jan 15, 2020","(Reuters Health) – People who have trouble falling asleep may be at increased risk of developing cognitive problems or dementia than their counterparts who sleep well, a research review suggests. Researchers examined data on 51 previously published studies that followed middle-aged and older people in North America, Europe and East Asia for at least several years to see if sleep issues were associated with cognitive health over time. Individuals with insomnia were 27% more likely to develop cognitive problems, the study found. People who had what’s known as sleep inadequacy, or an insufficient amount of quality rest, were 25% more likely to develop dementia, the researchers also found. So-called sleep inefficiency, or spending too much time wide awake in bed, was associated with a 24% greater chance of cognitive decline, the study team reports in Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, & Psychiatry. “These findings suggested that sleep management might serve as a promising target for dementia prevention,” said lead study author Dr. Wei Xu of Qingdao University in China. While the study wasn’t designed to determine whether or how sleep problems directly cause cognitive decline or dementia, there are several possible explanations, Xu said by email. Sleep problems might lead to cognitive impairment by causing inflammation of tissue in the central nervous system including the brain and spinal cord, Xu said. Sleep difficulties might also lead cognitive problems by causing or exacerbating so-called cerebral hypoxia, or a reduction in oxygen supply in the brain, Xu added. In addition, sleep problems could make the brain less efficient at removing waste and contribute to loss of brain cells or atrophy in key regions of the brain. Most of the studies in the current analysis followed participants for anywhere from about three years to 10, and a few tracked people for decades. Participants were typically aged 50 or older at the start of these studies, and they were often in their 70s. Sleep apnea, a nighttime breathing disorder, was associated with a 29% higher risk of cognitive problems, the analysis found. Spending a long time in bed was tied to a 15% greater chance of cognitive impairment. People who slept around six or seven hours a night appeared to have the lowest risk of cognitive disorders, while the risk was elevated for people who slept less than four hours or more than 10 hours a night. It’s possible that short sleep and other sleep problems contribute to degeneration in certain brain areas associated with dementia, the study authors note. Or, that people who already have such degeneration tend to sleep longer. Clinical trials are needed to test whether improving sleep quality and quantity affects later dementia risk, they write. Matthew Pase, a researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia who wasn’t involved in the study, agreed. “We still need more evidence to understand whether poor sleep leads to dementia and whether improving sleep can help mitigate risk.” Nevertheless, Pase said by email, “sleep is vitally important for general health and should be made a priority.” Most adults need at least seven hours of sleep a night, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Just because people struggle with sleep, however, doesn’t mean they’re destined to have cognitive problems, said Dr. Eric Larson of the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. “Insomnia and sleep complaints seem to cause a lot of anxiety that, in my judgment, is unwarranted if its source is brain health,” Larson, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “But if sleep problems interfere with everyday activities and wellbeing during the day, that’s an issue that people should consider raising with their physician.” Getting seven or eight hours of sleep a night also isn’t the only way to improve brain health, Larson said. “The range of `healthy sleep amounts’ is highly variable between individuals and becomes more so as people age,” Larson said.

180,"Dec 26, 2019","After a few minutes on the hiking trail, Dr. Duna Goswami felt her stress lessen. “It was like I was in a green tunnel. I could smell the fresh air. I could hear the water dripping from the trees,” she said. The Abbotsford physician was one of nine cancer survivors who participated in a program designed by a University of the Fraser Valley kinesiology professor to see if nature has the ability to reduce anxiety levels. Over eight weeks in September and October, the group met twice a week to hike in the Cultus Lake area. Early results, based on interviews with the participants, seem to prove the oft-touted notion that nature really does soothe the soul. “A number of them said it helped them realize how strong they were,” said lead researcher Dr. Iris Lesser. “When asked to rank their anxiety before and after the hike, we saw a drop in stress.” There are likely several causes for that, not least of which is the experience of being in nature itself. Lesser and her associates purposefully selected hikes that were not too difficult, but still lush and green. “We asked participants if they thought it would be the same if they were doing a walk in the city, and they thought it wouldn’t be,” she said. For Goswami, who finished treatments for breast cancer about a year ago, the setting made her feel peaceful. “I might have gone hiking in the summer before, but not in the fall. It changed my view. I realized I could get outside even in the rain,” she said. Goswami also reported several other benefits that proved common among participants. Hiking with a group of fellow cancer survivors provided support. “Having cancer is isolating,” she said. “Even though you’re surrounded by people who want to help, it is nice to be with those who know what it is like, who understand.” The physical exercise also brought benefits. During her treatment, which included chemotherapy, surgery and radiation, the physician felt ill and was unable to be active. For almost a year after, she still felt tired. “I was working, but I was very tired,” she said. Lesser said the benefits of exercise for stroke and cardiac patients are well known, but using exercise in cancer treatment is still a new field. “We knew going in there might be several different factors at work in our results,” she said. “In an effort to untangle them, we tried to ask questions that were specific to each component.” It appears clear that participants benefited from being in nature, as well as the social support and physical activity that hiking entailed. The researcher was encouraged in her study by local oncologists who identified a gap in survivor care. “They felt like patients should be better supported after treatment, but they didn’t have the time to help them navigate that part,” she said. Lesser would eventually like to see a program for cancer survivors in the model of a support group that incorporates nature and physical activity. In the meantime, she hopes to run another session in the spring to provide her with more data. The hikes will take place in the Chilliwack area.

181,"Dec 22, 2019","My most remembered Christmases were as a child in the snow and Prairie cold when the holiday season officially began on Stir-Up Sunday and ramped up from there. On the last Sunday before Advent, the candied fruits, nuts and batter are transformed into Christmas cakes then wrapped in cheesecloth and soaked in brandy for a month. It’s an English tradition and on a recent visit to Edinburgh’s Holyrood Palace I learned that The Queen herself often has a hand in the always stirring clockwise as tradition requires using a Scottish spurtle, which is a wooden paddle. After church on the first Sunday in December, we’d put on our warmest clothes to go to pick our tree from amongst the frozen, flattened firs that had been trucked in from British Columbia. If it was very cold, the process of hefting the trees and picking the heaviest (presumably it had the most branches) was speeded up. It was only hours later when the branches had thawed and dropped, you’d know whether it was a lucky year or whether Dad would be bringing out the drill and wire to restructure the tree so the bald spot was filled. After that, Mom had party dresses to finish. There were cookies to be baked, presents bought, invitations extended and accepted and the biggest bird available bought and thawed. Those best Christmases — joyous, raucous, exhausting days of too much of everything — are long past. The children haven’t just grown up, they’re grandparents now. Our family has morphed into many families. Over the years, I’ve had many different kinds of Christmas. Some were spent by the pool or at the beach. Some were in the rain with one spectacular Christmas on the stormy west coast of Vancouver Island. There’ve been years spent with friends, not family. Through them all, I’ve taken bits and pieces from the past — shortbread made from Grandma’s recipe, the stocking I’ve had since I was two, favourite carols and, often, mincemeat. But this Christmas will be unlike any other. It will only be Mom and me at Christmas lunch, not dinner. Of course, we’ll be surrounded by others who have no family or friends to go to. We’ll sit at a beautifully decorated table being served turkey and all the trimmings prepared by the lovely chef and his staff at the retirement residence. It is Mom’s first Christmas there, culminating a year of too many painful changes and a dreadful sense of loss. “I have no turkey and no oven,” Mom said tearfully last week. I have nothing to give anyone who comes to visit.” It was only the latest in a long string of seasonal regrets. For Mom, Christmas has always been about giving. But at 91, no longer driving and with walking a challenge, Mom has reluctantly been retired from all if it. Mom’s elves did what little shopping there was this year. For most on her list, cheques were written with Merry Christmas in the memo line. As welcome as money may be for the recipient and even as needed as it may be, the truth is there’s much less joy in the giving. Gone was all the stuff that so many of us complain about. Therewas no shopping amid bustling crowds with annoying carols playing on endless loops. There was no anxiety about what to buy. But there were also no serendipitous moments of finding the perfect gift for someone who may not normally have been on the list. Noeyes will light up as someone discovers a treasure hidden inside a beautifully or crazily wrapped package under the tree. Inadvertently, my Mom has reminded me that despite all our complaints and anxiety, it’s giving of yourself that is the real joy of Christmas. It’s the love with which the cookies are made, not the quality of the ingredients. It’s about waking up so early to put a turkey in the oven that you risk surprising Santa so that in the darkest month of the year you cangather around you and share with friends and family — no matter how perfect or imperfect they may be. That’s what makes it all so special. But Christmas isn’t only a time to give. It’s also a time to be grateful for what we receive, for what others do for us, for what we have. And, as the years march on, to be grateful for what we’ve shared. Merry Christmas to you and yours. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
182,"Dec 16, 2019","The disciplinary action taken against Diamondali Tejani paints a stark picture of the challenges that the College of Pharmacists of B.C. has had reining in bad operators. Tejani finally had his registration suspended beginning Sept. 1 and has been forbidden from being a pharmacy manager, director, owner or shareholder in a pharmacy for two years and fined him $15,000 for what he did and didn’t do in 2016. It was the third time he’d been disciplined. In 2012, his methadone dispensing privileges were suspended for 30 days, but there were no other details included in the college’s posting on its website. In 2000, he was suspended for three weeks following his conviction in provincial court for tax evasion. The cause for the most recent suspension dates back to between July 8 and Nov. 25, 2016. Tejani paid cash incentives to drug users to fill their daily dispensing orders. As owner, manager and a pharmacist at Surrey’s Boston Pharmacy, the College also said he would have, or should have, known that a patient consultation was required every day. That wasn’t the end of it. His staff didn’t enter or reverse daily dispense prescriptions on PharmaNet when the patient didn’t show up. Instead, they’d provide patients with missed doses and also dispensed several prescriptions without prescription labels. Daily dispenses of methadone can be a lucrative business. British Columbia allows pharmacists to charge up to $10 for each prescription for up to three prescriptions each day. That’s in addition to the fees they collect for witnessing the ingestion of methadone. The most recent figures show the total pharmacy costs for methadone maintenance for 13,894 patients was nearly $46 million in 2011/2012 — $40 million of which was paid by Pharmacare. Last year, an estimated 15,400 British Columbians were using methadone as a treatment for opioid addiction. Providing methadone daily is lucrative enough that pharmacists like Tejani have actively courted business. Some still do. Physicians, recovery house operators and recovering addicts have all told me about pharmacies offering incentives as well as threats. The kickbacks include money to recovery house operators who insist on residents going to a particular pharmacy for their three daily dispenses and money or gifts to customers themselves. I’ve been told about some recovery house operators threatening to evict residents unless they go to those pharmacies with their three daily scripts. I’ve heard physicians folding under pressure from patients who will be evicted unless they get daily scripts for methadone and usually a sleeping pill or an over-the-counter pain medication like naproxen (a.k.a. Aleve). Their justification? It’s better for recovering addicts to have a roof over their heads than be homeless. The College gets those complaints. But many of the complaints are never filed because as several recovery home residents have told me, ‘Who’s going to believe an addict?’ The College’s members also haven’t always supported its actions. When the College passed a bylaw in 2013 to outlaw incentives, it resulted in a three year court battle with Safeway and Thrifty Foods who wanted prescriptions to be part of their loyalty rewards programs. But the appellate court sided with the College and, finally, it was able to enforce the bylaws similar to what Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador have had in place since 2008. Still it’s fair to say that professionals’ ability to regulate themselves has been a long-standing issue here, dating back at least to a 2003 ombudsman’s report that found public trust lacking. This April, British expert Harry Cayton filed a report to the government that recommended a new regulatoryframeworkfor health professionals that will significantly reduce their autonomy. Instead of members electing half or two-thirds of college’s boards, the health minister would appoint them along with all the public members. All college boards would also be required to have equal numbers of professionals and members of the public. The College of Pharmacists would be one of only five professional regulatory bodies because of its unique jurisdiction over drug schedules regulation and operation of pharmacies. The others would be the two largest — the College of Physicians and Surgeons and the nurses. The other 15 would be lumped into two new colleges — one for oral and one for everything else from chiropractors to lab technicians to speech and hearing professionals. Colleges would be overseen by a separate body that reports to the minister. Colleges would continue to investigate complaints, but another separate, independent panel appointed by the minister would make the disciplinary decisions. Cayton also recommended firm time limits for each stage of investigations and the elimination of professionals’ ability to negotiate agreements/settlements late in the process. The government is acceptingonline feedbackuntil Jan. 10 Presumably after that, it will move ahead with changes. Clearly, there are problems with the current system. But it’s an open question whether a complete overhaul will to lead to better quality services care or whether it will mean more government control and more bureaucracy. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @bramham_daphne"
183,"Dec 12, 2019","The B.C. seniors’ advocate has launched an in-depth study of elder abuse with the goal of releasing a report with recommendations next year. Isobel Mackenzie said Thursday that her office has collected data on elder abuse for the past five years, but it’s become clear to her the information isn’t meaningful because there’s no standardized way for anyone who sees elder abuse to report it. Mackenzie said herOffice of the Seniors Advocatein Victoria is reviewing provincial legislation and has started on a consultation process as part of its “systemic review” of elder abuse. “We look to a report coming out later in 2020 with some recommendations on how we can better gather information and better inform the public and start to have some reliable information and some confidence that we are providing a robust system for reporting and tracking and dealing with elder abuse,” she said. “It is an issue that not only seniors feel passionately about, the public at large does as well.” Mackenzie made the comments during the release ofMonitoring Seniors Services 2019, her annual report on assessing services for seniors in areas such as health care, housing, transportation and income. A total of 1,626 cases of abuse, neglect and self-neglect were reported in 2018 to provincial agencies. However,the reportsaid the figure should be “interpreted with caution because it is incomplete, inconsistently reported and prone to subjective bias due to lack of reporting criteria.” Mackenzie said the report also found that by far the main form of transportation for seniors remains private vehicles. She said 78 per cent of people aged 65 have a driver’s licence, an increase of four per cent which matches the four-per-cent increase to 912,725 in the total number of seniors in B.C. Of the 72,000 driver fitness cases in 2018 for those 80 years of age and older, about 90 per cent were successfully completed in the doctor’s office, she said. “People who get the notice when they reach 80, and every two years thereafter, to go to the doctor’s office, overwhelmingly are going to come out with no further testing required,” she said. “The message I want to get out to seniors is that if you think you’re able to drive, you probably are.” She added that most seniors surrender their driver’s licence on their own terms rather than through the provincial testing process. Other highlights from the 96-pagereportinclude: • Most seniors are “generally healthy,” with 19 per cent living with high-complexity chronic health conditions. Six per cent are living with dementia. Both figures have “remained relatively stable over the last five years,”the report says. • Since 2015-16, the number of home-care complaints to the Patient Care Quality Office has risen steadily and increased by 17 per cent in 2018-19 compared to the previous year. • Ninety-three per cent of seniors, and 72 per cent of those aged 85 or older, live independently in private dwellings; only six per cent of seniors are in assisted living or long-term care. kevingriffin@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

184,"Dec 09, 2019","The signs first appeared at the age of 29. “I saw a photo of myself in a bathing suit,” says Arya Sharma. “I noticed folds that weren’t there before.” That he’d put on some weight was hardly a revelation. He was living in Berlin at the time and enjoying his share of beer and bratwurst. So Sharma began walking more and put down the lagers. “I liked bratwurst too much to cut down on that,” he admits. But some 30 years later, now a professor of medicine at the University of Alberta and the scientific director of Obesity Canada, Sharma is all too aware of the risks of ignoring what is often referred to with bemusement as “middle-age spread.” There are57 comorbiditiesassociated with obesity, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dementia. And yet as Sharma explains, “As we get older, biology sets us up for weight gain.” That’s particularly troubling news for Canada, where themedian agehas been holding steady at about 41 — just asrates of obesityare rising, particularly among those aged 35-49. The impact of age on metabolism is partly to blame. After 20, the body burns 10 to 15 fewer calories every day. “By the age of 50, we could be burning nearly 400 fewer calories a day. If you’re still eating the same amount of food as when you were 20, you’ll gain weight,” says Sharma. Hormones are another factor. Testosterone, the male sex hormone, results in a decrease in body fat; estrogen, the female sex hormone, also prevents weight gain. But both decrease as we age. “Studies show that post-menopausal women store more fat,” says Sylvia Santosa, a professor in Concordia University’s Department of Health, Kinesiology and Applied Physiology. “We also see that with a chronic decrease in testosterone, which occurs during andropause or male menopause, men also have an increase in body fat.” Hormones even dictate the middle-aged physique, with a decrease in estrogen leading women to gain weight around their hips and thighs, and a decrease in testosterone causing men to gain weight around their bellies. Hormone replacement therapy can help prevent weight gain associated with middle age, says Santosa, but it remains controversial because of possible links to cardiovascular disease. Women are more likely to gain weight throughout their lives because of hormonal fluctuations. “I still haven’t lost the weight I gained during my second pregnancy. My daughter is now two,” Santosa says. Monitoring our weight can help us maintain our weight, “or at least not gain too much,” says Santosa. Keeping a food diary can also be helpful. Exercise alone seldom results in weight loss. “You need the dietary component,” she says. But Sharma cautions against diets, any diet. “Bodies like to put on weight, but they don’t like to lose it,” he says. “A diet only works if you stay on it for the rest of your life. That’s difficult since most diets are restrictive.” Sharma believes behavioural measures, medications and, in some cases, bariatric surgery are most effective in the long-term treatment of obesity. Governments are also on the case. Last year, Canada banned industrial transfats, making it illegal for manufacturers to add PHOs — partially hydrogenated oils — to foods sold here. A policy document called Let’s Get Moving was also designed to get Canadians moving more; only 18 per cent of Canadian adults meet physical activity guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity every week. Still more is needed, says Sharma. Although the recent reissue of the Canada Food Guide offers a plan for healthy eating, for example, it does not address obesity. And the government still doesn’t recognize obesity as a chronic disease. “This would increase access to behavioral therapy and medications for obesity,” he says. “Most health plans don’t cover those things.”"
185,"Dec 07, 2019","Joe Buenacruz stares intently at the rectangle of green paper in his hands. He’s very focused on folding it into an accordion-like shape to make a Christmas tree for a card. On a rainy Monday morning he’s one of six seniors taking part in a program for people with dementia at theRobert Nimi Nikkei Home, the Japanese-Canadian assisted living home in Burnaby. The day program is called Iki Iki, a Japanese word pronounced “eeekee eeekee” that translates into lively, lively! It’s unique among Metro Vancouver dementia programs because it’s based on a person-centred, Japanese approach to dementia that focuses on the particular needs of each participant. In Iki Iki, an activity might involve singing or catching a ball. But because dementia develops differently in each person, she or he might not be able to sing or catch. If that’s the case, volunteers will work with participants to create a variation to match their abilities so they feel included. Iki Iki is also unusual in another way. Most dementia programs in care homes are for residents only. But Iki Iki is open to people in the community such as Buenacruz, who arrives for the day program by HandyDart. Seated at the table with Buenacruz is Yoko Watase, the Nikkei Home’s outreach coordinator and one of the founders of the Iki Iki program. “Can you glue here?” Watase asks Buenacruz, referring to the bent branches of the paper tree in the card’s centrefold. He daubs the glue stick on the little rectangle of green to attach it to the card. “Mostly finished,” Buenacruz, 83, says. At the centre of Iki Iki is the Japanese idea of omotenashi, a word that means serving someone without being servile. It’s a concept that’s at the heart of Japan’s reputation for hospitality. At Iki Iki, it means making each senior the star. The Nikkei Home, which opened in 2002 with 59 units, is withinNikkei Place, aJapanese-Canadian village without fences.The village also includes a Japanese food store and Japanese restaurant,Hi Genki, which is open to the public and also serves meals to seniors living in the home. Next door is theNikkei National Museum and Cultural Centre, which holds exhibitions and organizes activities. Across the street isNew Sakuro-so, a 34-unit, subsidized, independent-living apartment building. At Iki Iki, being a star begins as soon as everyone arrives in the morning. Each senior is greeted individually. “From the moment a participant arrives … a volunteer is there to welcome them and continue the welcome with a series of hello and how are you, and perform a blood pressure and weight health check,” according to a tool kit for the program. “It is about providing welcoming, warm and friendly care to every participant.” On the day Buenacruz attended, there was one volunteer for every three participants. When Iki Iki includes participants with more advanced dementia, the number of volunteers increases so there are as many as one for every two participants. Gina Hall, Buenacruz’s daughter and the manager at Nikkei Place, said she likes the kind of physical and mental challenges that Iki Iki offers her father. In another dementia program her dad attended, the focus was on participants who knew the answers rather than on participation by everyone, Hall said. She said it’s difficult to assess the impact of Iki Iki’s approach on her father because of the progression of his Alzheimer’s disease. During our brief interview, Buenacruz often laughed and smiled. “It’s definitely person-centred and has a lot more volunteers,” she said about Iki Iki. “It’s based on theories about dementia and levels of assistance that depend on that’s person’s abilities.” Karen Kobayashi, a sociologist and gerontologist at the University of Victoria, was part of the team that helped develop Iki Iki. The idea for Iki Iki is adopted from similar programs in Japan, where28 per cent of the population is 65 years of age or older. By 2065, that’s expected to increase to 38 per cent, turning Japan into a“super-aged society”and what’s believed to be the world’s most-elderly country. Japan has one of the highest life expectancies in the world: 84 years of age. It also has a significant number of peopleliving with dementia: an estimated 4.6 million in 2018, increasing to 7.3 million by 2025. Iki Iki wasdesigned for Japanese-Canadians with cognitive challenges and mild-to-moderate dementia, said Kobayashi, who is also a research affiliate with theInstitute on Aging and Lifelong Health. “It’s expanded to include participants who come from other ethnocultural minority groups,” she said. “The universality of this program is what we’re trying to underscore.” The program includes exercise, social interaction through games and singing, storytelling, participating in crafts and artmaking, and sharing through food. Iki Iki has been adapted to fit the participants: on Mondays, the program is in English to accommodate people such as Buenacruz, who is Filipino-Canadian, and another participant, a third-generation Chinese-Canadian who speaks no Chinese language. On Wednesdays and Fridays it’s in Japanese. Kobayashi cited the Japanese island ofOkinawa and its Blue Zone, one of the regions of the world where people live exceptionally long lives, as an inspiration for Iki Iki. She said one of the reasons why the Okinawan zone has the largest percentages of centenarians in the world is because of the varied social interactions among the elderly — along with physical activity and eating well. On Monday at Iki Iki, Buenacruz and the other participants were served breaded salmon filets with white rice and vegetables. “Dining together in Iki Iki allows them to feel like they’re part of a community,” Kobayashi said. “It’s an example of relational care: That means care between participants and staff, participants and volunteers, and participants and family members. It’s all done to improve quality of life.” Kobayashi said other health-authority-funded dementia day programs aren’t always as flexible as Iki Iki in adapting to the different needs of its participants. “Health-authority programs or mainstream programs are more a one-size-fits-all kind of approach to dementia care that is very different from the person-centeredness of Iki Iki,” she said. “That’s the recognition of personhood. You recognize that someone is a person despite cognitive deficits.” But matching activities to each person’s abilities requires trained staff or volunteers. Iki Iki, for example, started out as a program for residents of the Nikkei Home in 2013 and only expanded to include non-residents when the program had enough volunteers. Iki Iki has since expanded even further, and is now offered at Japanese-Canadian community centres in Vancouver and Richmond. There is also a Roman Catholic faith-based version at Hall’s church, Our Lady of Mercy in Burnaby. Simply translating material or having a volunteer who speaks another language isn’t always enough when it comes to running a successful multicultural dementia program, Kobayashi said. Programs need to recognize the importance of cultural differences such as food. An immigrant or refugee from another country, for example, whose dementia develops may start to want to eat only the traditional foods they grew up with as youngsters in their country of origin. “This is a program that addresses issues of inequality and inequity with regards to access to community-based care for visible minority, immigrant and older adults and their caregivers,” she said. “The Ministry of Health is actively promoting person-centred programs in long-term care facilities. In home and community care, this approach may be a little more costly. If you want to keep people in the community for longer with higher quality of life, this is the kind of program you need.” Language preference can change as dementia develops Caregivers are discovering that a person with dementia for whom English is a second language can revert to the language they spoke as a youngster. Yoko Watase, outreach coordinator at Nikkei Home, said research in Japan shows that the language a person speaks between ages nine and 15 is critical in determining the default language as dementia progresses. Watase said the family of one elderly woman who speaks Japanese and English worries that if she starts to speak Japanese only as her dementia progresses, her family members, who speak only English, won’t be able to communicate with her. Karen Kobayashi, a gerontologist and sociologist at the University of Victoria, said research shows that long-term memory comes to the fore as short-term memory weakens in people living with dementia. Immigrants who have spent most of their adult working lives in Canada speaking English can revert to their native language, whether they came from Japan, Germany or Finland. “You might meet them on one day but they won’t remember you the next day or what they had for lunch yesterday,” she said. “What they will remember are childhood lunches that their mother served them on Saturday or the song they sang when in school.” Dementia in B.C.: • Number of people 65-years-and-older living with dementia: 70,000. • By 2033: 120,000.

186,"Nov 30, 2019","An 83-year-old New York woman is on a quest to find her one true love. And she’s ditching dating app Tinder to do so. Having spent more than three decades working the dating scene, Hell’s Kitchen resident Hattie Wiener is finally ready to settle down. According to theNew York Post, Wiener – who found a lot of initial success at hooking up with guys using Tinder – doesn’t want to settle with someone her own age. The cougar said she wants to be with someone at least 20 years younger than her. What I would desire from my life is a partner. One that’s turned on by me, and I’m turned on by him. So I would want a man, I would guess that’s 60,” Wienertold Barcroft. “(With) Tinder I see them and we do become attracted to each other, and I could see that we’ll have a good night together. Then I don’t hear from them again.” While Tinder has entertained Wiener with a steady stream of men, she admitted she didn’t want to “get a man on a dating site” but kept hearing about other women get life partners online so she decided to give it a shot. After divorcing in her 50s, the mother of two and grandmother of three developed a craving for younger fellows.  The cougar spent 35 years dating younger men, which earned her the nickname “Retroage”, according to the Post. Wiener earned the “Tinder Granny” moniker after using dating apps to liven up her sex life. She claims she received 19-20 hook-up requests from younger men a day. Ironically, Wiener said she used dating apps with the original intent of finding a long-term partner. The senior’s sexual escapades have been documented on a variety of reality television shows, which include “Extreme Cougar Wives” and “Sister Wives.” Finding a perfect partner hasn’t been easy, she admits. Wiener said she found an “excellent match” with a 60-year-old man, but it didn’t last because “he did not want to get that attached and have a relationship with a woman my age.” She notes it’s rare for a younger man to want to shack up with a much older woman. Sexual quests aside, Wiener did say using Tinder gave her some great life lessons. “I did find that all of them were good experiences, different,” she said, as reported by the Post. “What I learned is that men are people instead of potential hard d–ks or orgasm givers or G spot geniuses.”"
187,"Nov 25, 2019","In Canada’s first dementia village, residents can walk by themselves outdoors on what seems like a never-ending path. They can leave by the front door of their house and walk along Main Street past the rock garden to the community centre. Or they can walk toward the Red Barn and circle behind near Bradshaw Meadow. There’s eight-foot fencing that’s mostly made of cedar bounding the property so residents can’t wander and leaveThe Village,which has one controlled entrance and exit. The needs of people living with dementia permeates every aspect of the design, from the pathways around the five-acre site to the spacious interior rooms able to accommodate wheelchairs. Eitaro Hirota, The Village project architect withNSDA Architects, said one of the principles of designing for people withdementiais that you don’t want dead-end corridors or paths. “If you have a dead end, it goes to a destination so that it doesn’t seem that the path ends and there’s nothing there,” he said. A person living with dementia who comes up against a dead end can experience heightened anxiety. In some cases, it can lead to the person going through the door to the other side in what’s called ‘eloping.’ “If you create an environment like The Village, that urge is diminished,” Hirota said. “They have options. They have a variety of destinations to go to.” The Village opened earlier this summer in Langley. It’s inspired by De Hogeweyk, the world’s first dementia village that opened in The Netherlands in 2009. Built at a cost of $28 million, Langley’s The Village is designed to make it as easy as possible for someone with dementia to live their life independently. It has a beauty salon/barbershop where people can get their hair cut and styled. There’s a grocery store where residents can buy household items. At the community centre, you can order a coffee or have a meal. The Village is at 3920-198th St. on what’s known as the old Bradshaw Elementary School site. Barb Ruscheinski knows The Village well. Her mother Regina, who has dementia, is a resident, as is her aunt Kay Gorse who doesn’t. Both women were atMaple Ridge Seniors Villagebefore moving into The Village. She described the Maple Ridge home as a “wonderful place” with “very caring staff.” What it lacked, however, was the personal attention Ruscheinski’s mother needed. “We need someone who could pay more attention to her and get her involved in day-to day activities that she always loved to do,” she said. “It’s been such a positive experience for us and our family. We’re very happy to have them there.” Ruscheinski acknowledged the high cost of living at The Village. Including taxes, rates are $7,300 a month for regular residents and $8,300 a month for complex care. “We’re very fortunate that they can afford to be there,” she said. “I think the model is fantastic. I think it could be applied just about anywhere.” The Village builds on the kinds of assisted- and extended-care communities built byElroy Jespersenduring the past 30 years. Jespersen is the vice-president, special projects, forVerve Senior Livingand the project leader for The Village. The site had to be big enough, Jespersen said, so that the residences could all be built on one level with no stairs. “One of our principles is for villagers to roam free so they can walk out the door without any stairs or barriers,” he said. The Village has 38 residents, a little less than half of the 78 it’s designed to accommodate. Residents wear a Bluetooth-enabled wrist band that acts as an electronic key for their house and allows for real-time location monitoring. Earlier this spring, theAlzheimer’s Society of B.C. estimated that 70,000 people in B.C. are living withdementia, an umbrella term that can include many diseases and conditions such as Alzheimer’s, as well as head injuries. By 2033, as many as 120,000 people in B.C. could develop dementia. “We purposely need to move slowly because it’s new for everybody — new for the people who work here and new for the people who live here,” Jespersen said. One ofThe Village‘s unique elements is that each house has the same group of 10 staff who work with 12 residents. A small, consistent group makes it easier for villagers and residents to get to know one another. Jespersen took Postmedia News on a tour of Holly House, one of the unoccupied residences. The house was identified by its name out front and a symbol of a leaping deer, a visual cue for someone with dementia who loses the ability to read. Inside, Holly House looked like more like a big suburban home than an institutional care facility. In the bedroom, the wardrobe has a unique design. A person with dementia can mix up the sequence of things and end up wearing underwear over their clothes. The wardrobe rack, visible from the bed, allows clothes to be laid out in their proper order so that someone can dress themselves unassisted when they wake up in the morning. “Our success will be dependent on people who work here, how well they do their job and how long they stay. That’s our product — this is our packaging,” he said, referring to the surrounding buildings, paths and landscaping. Jespersen said he’d love for researchers to come intoThe Villageto study whether in fact a village designed and built for people with dementia is a better way to care for them. “If it is, and we can demonstrate that, then it’s something the government can look to and say, ‘Maybe we should be looking to do more of these,’ ” he said. “We’d love to be able to partner with government and make it more affordable.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
188,,"More than 18 months ago we wrote about Victoria Vigneau, a Canadian teenager with Cystic Fibrosis. Like other Canadians with CF, Victoria knows there are drugs that will save her life — drugs she cannot get. Orkambi, a gene-altering medication that treats CF, is available from Vertex pharmaceuticals; it is effective and it is very expensive. Nonetheless, 18 other countries including Australia, Austria, Germany, Sweden and, recently, Wales, have decided to fund the drugs for their CF population. Canada continues to do nothing. “So many other countries have said yes toOrkambi,” says Victoria’s mother, Carol Vigneau. “We’re still fighting for it.” Hopes are high that the new federal Health Minister, Patty Hajdu, will get the ball rolling on drugs such as Orkambi. A national pharmacare plan is in the works, and it can’t come soon enough for those who need drugs for rare and orphan diseases. In Ontario, Christine Elliott has said that as the pharmacare plan is put in place for all Canadians, Ontario is looking for some specific federal solutions around such medications — many of which are extraordinarily expensive. “The issue of rare diseases and orphan drugs is one of Minister Elliott’s top priorities as the new chair of the provincial-territorial health table,” confirms Elliott’s spokesperson, Hayley Chazan. “She looks forward to addressing her concerns and identifying possible solutions with respect to this important issue with the newly appointed federal health minister over the coming weeks and months.” Victoria is in grade 12 now and hopes to be a nurse or a social worker when she’s an adult. Unfortunately, the frequent hospitalizations she needs because of CF cause her to fall behind in school. “It’s been almost two years since Victoria and I started to fight for Orkambi,” Vigneau says. “We are no further ahead then we were when we started. It’s so frustrating.” At the moment, Victoria’s health is pretty good, “Knock on wood,” says Vigneau. “But winter is coming. We’ve already had one hospital admission in September. There’s probably another one coming up. She goes back to Sick Kids for a checkup next week. “We never know with this, which is the worst thing.” Vertex makes Symdeko, Orkambi and Kalydeco; Kalydeco is government funded in Ontario, a decision the Liberals were shamed into making a few years ago. Without these drugs, many CF patients will die young, with numerous hospitalizations and other medical interventions along the way — at a cost to taxpayers that makes the price of Vertex’s drugs look small by comparison. Lawyer (and CF patient) Chris MacLeod, chair of the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Treatment Society, has said for years that Canada needs to negotiate a portfolio deal with Vertex — a deal that will set a price on all their drugs once and for all, new drugs included. He has offered to negotiate — gratis — on behalf of the government. But, “Canada is not even at the negotiating table,” he says.“I assure you the drug is available at a minimum of a 50% discount. There’s a long-standing offer to the government.” Meanwhile, as the government does nothing, Vertex has introduced a new medication called Trikafta that it is expected to treat 90% of CF patients successfully. “Trikafta is the Holy Grail,” says McLeod, who doubts Vertex will even bring it to Canada. “Why would they bother? They’ve been rejected three times already on Orkambi.” McLeod worries that part of the government resistance in all this can be traced to an anti-corporate stance. Yes, Vertex drugs are hugely expensive. Yes, the company’s senior officials are paid obscene amounts of money. “But the only people on earth making these drugs in Europe and the U.S. are multinationals. We’ve got none,” says MacLeod. The bureaucrats, he adds, should be ashamed of themselves. “They are health economists with great benefits packages and salaries, and they sit and pontificate about how bad the corporate people are.” CF patients across the country need to see a deal with Vertex, and they need it quickly. “Canada is the only country left who refuses to negotiate with the drug company,” MacLeod  says. “Nobody pays sticker price on a car. Nobody pays sticker price on these drugs.” “What is Canada waiting for?” lbraun@postmedia.com"
189,"Oct 04, 2019","STRAIGHT ARROWS: A key factor in aerial combat — literally a matter of life and death — is to be in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. Having the sun behind you helps, too. Full marks, therefore, to the Royal Air Force’s Red Arrows aerobatics team that was scheduled for a Coal Harbour flypast at 1700 hours recently. With the declining sun glistening on their red-white-and-blue tail fins, the team’s BAE Hawk trainer jets skimmed over at 5 on the dot. As they banked and climbed away, workhorse aircraft — de Havilland Beaver and Otter float planes — resumed their everyday takeoffs and landings. Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart, Chief Constable Adam Palmer, Bard on The Beach artistic director Christopher Gaze and others watched the proceedings from the Pan Pacific hotel’s eighth-floor deck. They were guests of British High Commissioner to Canada, Susan le Jeune d’Allegeerschecque, formerly ambassador to Austria, and Vancouver-based consul-general Nicole Davison. “The Red Arrows are the best ambassador our country has,” said le Jeune d’Allegeerschecque, whose married name is more common in Brussels than London. As those two cities duke it out over Brexit, the fast-flying Red Arrows might remind Gaze and especially British Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Hamlet’s “slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.” Ditto for that soliloquy’s humbling conclusion: “And thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought.” HAPPY ENDING: Cultural organization heads sometimes roll amid a blizzard of finger-pointing, trustee bickering and other nastiness. Not at the Vancouver International Film Festival where eight-year executive director Jacqueline Dupuis announced in July that she’ll leave at year’s end. Looking as relaxed and, dare one say, glamorous as in 2011, Dupuis launched the 38th annual festival by escorting director Atom Egoyan to a screening of his Guest of Honour feature film and to a gala later. Although called “a masterful piece of subtly sophisticated filmmaking” in the VIFF program, showbiz bible Variety deemed the Egypt-born Torontonian’s picture “hopelessly muddled … overplotted and under-reasoned, hysterical and stiffly earnest.” CONSONANTAL DRIFT: If asked to define modern-day political equivocation, habitual phrase-tangler William Spooner might have replied with a self-defence tip: “Trust in judo.” Then again, his spoonerism of voters’ “elementary affluence” would entail a mere vowel movement. MORE AID: Dr. Peter Jepson-Young succumbed to HIV/AIDS in 1992 at age 35. CBC-TV’s weekly Dr. Peter Diaries detailed his then-almost-inevitable approach to death. Founded that year, the Dr. Peter AIDS Centre and related foundation began caring for those still living. A decade later, Nathan Fong recruited fellow chefs to launch the annual Passions gala that reportedly raised a record $220,000 recently. Executive director Scott Elliott said the centre now helps clients deal with hepatitis C and supports older ones “isolated and not participating in health care.” It will soon offer twice-weekly programs for female HIV/AIDS patients, he said. DIRTY DISHES: Wearing a whistle-clean apron, Dirty Apron co-founder David Robertson marked the cooking school’s 10th anniversary by launching his second cookbook, Gather. Some of the 100,000 folk he’s reportedly taught filled the Beatty Street joint to buy the book and sample such dishes as sake-braised pork belly, seafood and chorizo belly and Robertson’s sensational Thai-style coconut-lemon grass braised beef short ribs. TAIPEI TIES: There were complaints when electioneering defence minister Harjit Sajjan attended a recent gala honouring China. Not so when San Francisco-based Taiwan Tourism Bureau director Linda Lin inaugurated Maggie Sung to head our town’s new information centre for the island China claims to own. The ceremony followed Vancouver’s recent 100-event TaiwanFest that began celebrating Taiwanese culture in 1991. BED BUDS: As the huge IDS design exhibition ran downtown, furniture designer-manufacturer Kate Duncan and curator Amber Kingsnorth staged their own fifth annual show titled Address. It occupied five-times-larger premises at Malkin Street’s Eastside Studios. As well as mature and emerging exhibitors from Pacific Northwest states and Alberta, the event welcomed newcomers from Saskatoon, Toronto and Texas. Port Alberni-raised Duncan exhibited a solid walnut bed and side tables tagged at $30,000. Calgary native Kyle Parent added a $2,100 bedspread from his ktwpquilts.com concern. GO EAST, YOUNG WOMAN: Vancouver’s creative activities are enhanced — some say dominated — east of Main Street.

190,"Sep 30, 2019","LONDON — A hundred scientists who gave fruit flies a triple-drug combination treatment and found that it extended their lives by almost 50% say their work offers clues on how to fight aging in people. The researchers said their aim is not to find the secret of eternal life but to figure out the mechanism of the aging process to find ways to help people stay healthy for longer. “We are not trying to cheat death, but help people be healthy and disease-free in their final years,” said Linda Partridge, a professor at University College London’s Institute of Healthy Ageing and the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing who co-led the work. The three drugs — the mood stabilizer lithium, a cancer treatment called trametinib and an immune regulator called rapamycin — target different cellular processes and had a “quite remarkable” impact on the flies’ lifespans, the scientists said. And since the three drugs are all already in use as medical treatments, they are known to be safe to use in people, we have found that a combination drug treatment … may be an effective way to slow down the aging process,” said Jorge Castillo-Quan, who co-led the research. Partridge said the findings add to growing evidence that so-called polypills — pills that combine low doses of multiple drugs — could one day help prevent age-related diseases. “This may be possible by combining the drugs we’re investigating with other promising drugs, but there is a long way to go,” she said. This research adds to previous studies finding that individually, lithium, trametinib and rapamycin can each extend lifespan in fruit flies. That evidence has also been supported by further studies in mice and worms, the scientists said. In this study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, Castillo-Quan’s team gave fruit flies doses of the three drugs separately and in combination. Each drug individually extended lifespan by an average of 11%, they found, and pairing two drugs extended lifespan by around 30%. But when all three were combined, the fruit flies lived 48% longer than flies that did not get the treatment. “We found it was quite remarkable that this drug combination enabled them to live 48% longer,” said Castillo-Quan, who now works at Harvard Medical School in the United States. The researchers said they plan to conduct more studies to try to decipher exactly how the drugs work in combination with each other. They hope to move on to experiments in more complex animals, such as mice, to gauge the effects on the entire body before eventually progressing to human trials."
191,"Aug 08, 2019","When you think about shady drug dealers, it’s usually in the context of the Downtown Eastside or the Surrey Strip. But in the last three months alone, the B.C. College of Pharmacists has rooted out some white-collar guys who were running illegal pharmacies, faking prescriptions, doling out methadone improperly, and plumping up their dispensing numbers with made-up prescriptions for over-the-counter drugs and vitamins. While their crimes don’t have the same kind of mean-streets vibe as the illicit dealers, it doesn’t mean that the guys in white coats didn’t do some seriously bad things. Let’s start with William Byron Sam, who is still under investigation by the college for “knowingly operating an unlicensed pharmacy.” Acomplaint outcome reportposted on the college’s website says “serious public risk indicators were present within the pharmacy.“ It doesn’t spell out what those serious risks are and, in an emailed response to my question about where Sam was getting the drugs from, the college refused to say. In March, the college cancelled the licence for Garlane Pharmacy #2, which Sam was operating at 104-3380 Maquinna Dr. in Vancouver’s Champlain Heights. (It still has two five-star ratings on Yelp! So, if it’s a legitimate drugstore you’re after, you might want to check the college’s listings.) Sam’s problems began in 2015 with a practice review, which was followed up by a request for more information. In 2017, the college told him his conduct would be the subject of a hearing, admonishing him for failing to respond to the college after a practice review in 2015 and to a request for more information in 2016. In May, Salma Sadrudin Damji, another Vancouver pharmacist, was found to have used a prescription pad from a medical clinic and falsified 62 prescriptions for Schedule 1 drugs, which include heroin, LSD, ecstasy and methaqualone (aka Quaalude) using three patient names and two physician names. In May, the college fined her $1,000, imposed a 90-day suspension and forbid her from owning or managing a pharmacy for three years or acting as a preceptor or mentor for pharmacy students. Beyond that, the college says it can’t comment. North Vancouver’s Davood Nekoi Panah provided monetary incentives to a patient, dispensed Schedule 1 drugs without an authorized prescription in unlabelled and mislabelled containers — all without taking reasonable steps to confirm the identify of the patients before giving them the drugs. He was fined $10,000. Starting Sept. 4, he can’t work for two months and can’t be a pharmacy manager or preceptor for two years. Questions about him were also met with a no-further-comment response from the college. Amandeep Khun-Khun has every appearance of being a good guy. From 2010 until 2012, he was on the college’s community practice advisory committee making recommendations related to community pharmacy practices. He was a preceptor for UBC pharmacy students and was quoted in UBC’s 2013 brochure aimed at recruiting other mentors. But in June, Khun-Khun was fined $30,000 and suspended from practice for 540 days. He can only return to full pharmacist status if he passes the college’s jurisprudence exam and completes an ethics course. The mailing address for his company, Khun-Khun Drugs, is the Shoppers Drug Mart on the tony South Granville Rise. Over three years, the Vancouver pharmacist processed more than 15,000 false prescriptions for vitamins and over-the-counter drugs — things like aspirin and ibuprofen — on the PharmaNet records of seven individuals. But those seven people didn’t know anything about it. Khun-Khun admitted he “directed pharmacy assistants to process transactions weekly on PharmaNet in order to artificially inflate the pharmacy’s prescription count.” He did it even though he had previously undertaken to comply with all ethical requirements after earlier complaints. Part of the reason Khun-Khun didn’t get caught earlier is because neither of the two full-time pharmacists working for him did what they were supposed to. The inquiry committee wrote that both of them “turned a blind eye” to what they knew or should have known was wrong. They knew or should have known that what was happening was wrong since the transactions were done without patients’ consent and were an improper use and access of personal information. William Wanyang Lu and Jason Wong were both working for Khun-Khun full-time. Both now have letters of reprimand on their permanent registration file and were required to pass both an ethics course and the college’s law exam or face 30-day suspensions. Yet Wong hasn’t deleted a comment on his LinkedIn profile that while he worked at Shoppers Drug Mart he was “coached with great mentors at this pharmacy including Amandeep Khun-Khun.” Among the others disciplined recently is Sing Man Tam. He was fined $10,000 and had a reprimand letter put on his permanent record for his “inadequate diligence and oversight” over two years related mainly to dispensing methadone to addicts to quell their cravings and minimize the effects of opioids. Tam processed prescriptions without authorization. He also didn’t witness its ingestion, which is legally required (and the reason that pharmacists get $17 for dispensing it rather than the usual $10 for other medications). He billed for methadone that was marked in the logs as having been “missed” and Tam delivered it without authorization by the doctor who wrote the prescription. For the past several years, the college has received close to 800 complaints, but many of those don’t require any disciplinary action or even a referral to an inquiry committee. Its statistics cover the 12 months from March 1 to the end of February. And while the most recent fines and suspensions may not seem to add up to much, the college is not always the final arbiter. The courts are. In March, Richmond pharmacist Jin Tong (Tom) Li was sentenced to a year of house arrest after pleading guilty to one count of obtaining more than $5,000 under a false pretence. The charge links back to thecollege’s disciplinary actionin 2016 after it found that Li had submitted more than 2,400 fraudulent claims to PharmaCare between 2013 and 2014 that cost the B.C. government $616,000. Coincidentally, Li’s pharmacy licence was reinstated as a pharmacist in October 2018, having been suspended for 540 days. He is still banned from being a manager, director or pharmacy owner or preceptor until 2023. dbramham@postmedia.com twitter.com/bramham_daphne CLICK HEREto report a typo. Is there more to this story?

192,"Jul 15, 2019","Dementia isn’t an inevitable part of aging, even for those carrying multiple genetic risk factors for the brain-ravaging disease, a new study suggests. Researchers who followed nearly 200,000 people found those at high genetic risk for dementia, but who didn’t smoke, who exercised regularly, drank alcohol in moderation and ate a Mediterranean-leaning diet lowered their dementia risk by a third. The findingschallenge the often fatalistic view of the memory-robbing illness, researchers said, and add to emerging theories that whatever is good for the heart is most probably good for the brain. “A healthy lifestyle was protective, even for the people who had a bad luck of the draw with their genetic inheritance,” said Dr. John Haaga, of the U.S. National Institute on Aging, one of the study’s funders. We need to be encouraged The study analyzed data from 196,383 people from the UK Biobank study, making it a considerably larger sample than anything done before. All were aged 60 and older, and free of dementia, at the start of the study. All were also genotyped, meaning their DNA was analyzed for genetic features linked to the risk of dementia, and then grouped into categories according to their risk: high, intermediate or low. People were also given a score based on four recognized risk factors for dementia (smoking status, physical activity, diet and alcohol consumption). “They told us a lot about themselves,” said lead author Dr. David Llewellyn, from the University of Exeter Medical School. For example: whether or not they smoked; how much fish they ate (the more the better); how much red meat they ate (“which is kind of more of a negative,” Llewellyn said); how many servings of fruits and vegetables they ate in a particular day; and how much they drank in a typical week. People were then grouped into favourable, intermediate or unfavourable lifestyle categories. Overall, people with a high genetic risk and an unhealthy lifestyle were nearly three times more likely to develop dementia compared to people with a low genetic risk and healthy habits. But good habits lowered the risk regardless of a person’s genetic vulnerability. Among people with a high genetic risk, 1.13 per cent of those with a healthy lifestyle developed dementia after eight years of follow-up, versus 1.78 per cent of those with less wholesome habits. According to Llewellyn, non-smokers, people who limited their alcohol consumption (moderate consumption was defined as no more than one standard drink a day for women, or two drinks per day for men), those who ate at least three servings of fruits and vegetables daily, and those who ate relatively little red meat scored highest on the lifestyle scale. “Someone who maybe commutes to work — they cycle in for 20 minutes and cycle home again — that would tick the box in terms of being physically active,” he added. It’s not just any one of these lifestyle changes, but the combination that appears to protect the mind. The underlying mechanisms aren’t entirely clear, though there are several plausible hypotheses, Llewellyn said from Los Angeles, where he presented his group’s work at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference. The human brain is a hungry organ. It requires a rich and constant supply of oxygen and glucose, and small disruptions to the blood supply to the brain make it vulnerable to dementia, he said. The brain also has to clear away debris and protein abnormalities that, in large enough amounts, can be toxic and lead to the tangles and plaques linked to Alzheimer’s disease. “If your circulatory and lymphatic systems are working, they’ll do a better job of cleaning out the bad stuff,” Haaga said. Most cases of dementia occur sporadically, in older people with multiple genetic risk factors. “I think the fundamental message needs to be that, (most people) don’t know what your genetic risk of dementia is, and, even if you did, there is very little you can do about it,” Llewellyn said. “But we need to be encouraged — if you live a healthy life you may be able to reduce your risk of dementia, whatever your genetic risk.” More than 419,000 Canadians aged 65 and older are diagnosed with dementia, two-thirds of them women. It is the only major cause of death in Western countries without an effective treatment, despite billions spent trying to find one. The study, published in this week’s issue of  JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, has several caveats. It doesn’t prove cause and effect, lifestyle factors were self-reported, people were followed up for a median of eight years only and some cases of dementia aren’t recorded in medical records or death registries. However, while the number of people at risk of dementia, because of age, is growing rapidly as the population ages, a person’s individual odds of getting dementia have been going down, at least for the last two decades, Haaga said. There are a number of theories as to why, “but big ones are that we’re doing a better job of controlling cardiovascular risks, people have given up smoking and people are better educated at older ages than they used to be.” Meaning, “There is some evidence that positive lifestyle has already been at work to help reduce the risk,”  he said. “We can’t guarantee you’ll never get it. But you’ll delay it, you’ll reduce your likelihood,” added Laura Middleton, an associate professor of kinesiology at the University of Waterloo. “Lifestyle is really, at this point, where the biggest bang for the buck is in terms of prevention. We don’t have good pharmaceutical treatments that can really extend life out or prevent dementia, yet. But I think reducing cases by a third could have considerable impact.” • Email:skirkey@postmedia.com| Twitter:sharon_kirkey‏"
193,"Jul 05, 2019","Helen Forewell wanted to make her husband’s final years as pleasant as possible after he was diagnosed with dementia, but she struggled to find him appropriate and timely help in B.C.’s health care system. “I was overwhelmed with the challenges of working with a system that ultimately failed us. To say that it is presently a broken system is an understatement,” Forewell, 74, wrote in a detailed letter of complaint to B.C.’s seniors advocate. The retired school teacher told Postmedia she fought hard to get the services she thought her husband Vince required, and is saddened she was unable to get them. Forewell said her local health authority was unable to offer her a consistent case manger to help her navigate the complicated seniors’ care system; she was unable to get home support at the time she needed it or with consistent staff to reduce her husband’s agitation over unknown people; she could not find a suitable daycare program so she could get some respite; and her husband was denied admission to a residential care facility, even though two family doctors determined she could no longer keep him at home. The Burnaby resident is speaking out in the hope of inspiring change in a system that the NDP government promised to improve with an injection of $548 million in additional funding between 2018 and 2021. “What are the tangible action plans now? Because if there is money, where is it going to be spent?” asked Forewell. “Are they going to put money into case managers? Into training?” Last year, Postmedia publisheda seven-part seriesexamining B.C.’s complicated and expensive seniors care system. It’s a system that will become even more overburdened as the population aged 65 and older is projected to grow from 950,000 this year to 1.6 million by 2040, when one out of every four British Columbians will be a senior. So, what has changed in the year since we analyzed this important public service? Health Minister Adrian Dix argues his government has had “a pretty good first year,” providing a long list of accomplishments. One of those wasa major changehe announced this week that means seniors wanting to go to a nursing home will no longer be forced to take the first bed available or fall to the bottom of the waiting list if they refuse it, a restrictive policy that has been in place for 17 years. Instead, as of July 15, they will be allowed to choose from their three preferred care homes and will have three days to make a decision when a bed becomes available. “There are real challenges in the system and I’m very proud of the progress we’ve made in the first year,” Dix said. “But none of this is perfect because it is taking place in the context of an increasing number of seniors.” Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s seniors advocate, agreed there have been improvements in the last year. “The proof is in the pudding that the money (government officials) said they are going to spend. We are starting to see that money being committed.” One of the biggest examples was $240 million to boost the average daily care hours at B.C.’s 293 long-term care facilitiesto 3.36 hours a resident by 2021from 3.14 last year. The majority of the cash so far has gone to privately run facilities so they can catch up to the care hours provided by the better funded homes run by health authorities. Dix said the NDP has made good on this promise so far: 950 new care aides have been hired, many existing part-time workers in part-time became full-time, additional post-secondary training seats were provided, and there are new labour protections for these workers. Although many more care aides still need to be hired, he said average daily care hours are now up to 3.24 hours per patient. Mackenzie highlighted other changes that will benefit seniors: • $75 million to fund an additional 8,435 adult daycare spaces, which provide an outing for seniors and respite for family members. • a plan to expand facility-based respite beds, where seniors living at home could spend a night to give a break to family members looking after them. • improvements to rent rebates and prescription drug deductibles for low-income seniors. That is the good news. The bad news is that home support services — a major element of seniors care in B.C. — are not meeting the needs of our aging population, Mackenzie said. “Seniors in our province tell me they want to age in their homes for as long as possible but the system which should enable that is falling short,” Mackenzie said last month when releasing her newest report,Home Support — We Can Do Better. “What we see here is a system that is woefully, woefully under servicing clients and distressed family care givers.” Home support workers help seniors with their hygiene, getting dressed and other daily chores but Mackenzie’s report found the unreliable, costly system hasn’t kept pace with demand: • Over the last five years, the seniors population has grown by 22 per cent but the number of home support clients has risen by only 15 per cent. • The rate of home support hours for those 85 and older has decreased 10.3 per cent in the last five years. • Nearly two-thirds of clients receive less than an hour of home support a day on average. • Three out of every five of the vulnerable residents admitted to long-term care had received no home support in the 90 days before admission. • Complaints to the provincial government about home support have increased 62 per cent in the last five years. Why is this the case? Mackenzie makes the argument that seniors and families need more home support but they simply can’t afford it. In most provinces, such as Ontario and Alberta, home support is free. B.C. is one of the few provinces that charges a fee, and it has the highest rates in Canada. In Metro Vancouver, the average fee is $38 an hour. Mackenzie found that a senior with an income of $27,800 is expected to pay $8,800 a year for once-a-day home support visits. “That’s clearly an issue,” Mackenzie said. “That’s 33 per cent of their income.” She does not believe seniors without home support simply don’t need the help. That’s because low-income seniors who receive a guaranteed income supplement from the provincial government, and therefore get their home care free, are five times more likely to use this service than the majority who have to pay. “It is fairly unaffordable for a big portion of seniors,” she said. Instead, it is more affordable for seniors to go into long-term care, which means 15 per cent of residents in these facilities could be living in the community. That’s 4,200 beds that could be freed up with more affordable home support and filled by those languishing on waiting lists for these long-term facilities. Dix argued Mackenzie’s report was based on statistics from before he became health minister and that his government has already made improvements to home support, often based on the advocate’s advice. Since the NDP was elected in 2017, there has been an increase, Dix said, of 281,761 home support hours and 188 full-time equivalent home support workers have been hired across four of B.C.’s five health authorities (numbers were not available for Vancouver Island). While accepting Mackenzie’s concerns, he noted the government has “considerable but not infinite” money to address them. He agreed the issue of affordability is an important one but stopped short of committing to lowering home care payments for seniors. However, he said low-income clients who are stressed by their bills could apply for a hardship waiver to cut their costs. Moira Hewitt, who is battling both age and multiple sclerosis, is adamant she does not want to enter long-term care, but said her home care situation has not improved since shefirst spoke with Postmedia a year ago. “I want to stay in my own home,” she said. But with the limited hours the care aides can visit, there isn’t time to take Hewitt, who uses a wheelchair, outside, even to visit a carp pond that is a two-minute walk away. “I’d like to go out instead of being a shut in, I’d like to go to the fish pond.” Beginning in 2010, Hewitt received four visits a day for just under an hour each, subsidized by the provincial government because her income is low. But when RRSP rules compelled her to start deregistering her savings in 2017, her income jumped to $52,000 and her subsidy was reduced. That means the care she received at no charge for years would now cost almost $1,700 a month, about 40 per cent of her income. Then, in February 2018, her care hours were cut. Her visits at 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. are still close to an hour, but the ones at 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. range from 20 to 30 minutes. Hewitt hopes her hours may improve later this year, after the provincial government announced in March thatprivately-run home support services will be moved back under health authoritiesin Metro Vancouver and southern Vancouver Island.Dix said at the time this change will improve scheduling, provide more stable hours for seniors, and make it easier to recruit staff. Right now, 94 per cent of seniors live at home, and only a fraction receive government-funded home care services, according to the seniors advocate. Three per cent are inassisted-livingfacilities, which vary widely in cost and services. More than 800 people are waiting for subsidized assisted living, a seven per cent increase over 2017. The final three per cent of seniors live inresidential care, which provides daily assistance for those with complex medical needs, and there are 1,379 people waiting for a bed. The government funds a total of 28,000 residential care beds, 70 per cent of them owned by private companies and 30 per cent run by health-authorities. The number of beds has remained stable, according to Mackenzie. But from the perspective of Daniel Fontaine, CEO of the B.C. Care Providers Association, that is a problem because there is increasing demand as the baby boomers age. Fontaine says only 151 new long-term care beds have been added in B.C. over the last two years, and his organization — which represents private care homes — would like 5,000 additional long-term care beds and 1,000 assisted living suites built over the next three years. “Every year that passes, we are falling farther and farther behind in terms of capacity,” he said. Dix, the health minister, argues the number of new beds the government has committed to open is closer to 225, but some of those facilities are still under construction. Fontaine also argues long-term facilities will need to hire 2,800 more care aides over the next five years, which will be a challenge. He said there is adrastic shortage of seniors’ care aides in B.C.’s interior, and the situation on Vancouver Island is not far behind. The B.C. Liberals, which oversaw seniors care for 16 years before the NDP’s election in 2017, last month blamed a shortage of care aides on new, too-restrictive hiring policies. “The NDP brought in harsh restrictions in 2018 that prevent many out-of-province community health workers from making an application to work here in B.C.,” said Liberal seniors care critic Linda Reid. “There is a shortage of qualified care workers in B.C. and we need to recruit from other provinces in order to ensure our seniors get the quality care they deserve.” Dix, though, argues these changes were started by the Liberals. Wayne Greggain lived at Sechelt Hospital for four months last year while on a waiting list for long-term care on the lower Sunshine Coast, after being diagnosed with cerebral amyloid angiopathy with inflammation of the brain, which is largely untreatable. “They just don’t have enough care homes up here, they don’t have enough beds,”  his wife Liz Szymanski-Greggain said Friday. She initially had hoped he would find a space in a local long-term care facility with private rooms, but instead he was offered a spot at Totem in Sechelt, where he shares a room with three other residents. There, however, he has thrived because of the socialization. For seniors still living at home, Mackenzie found that nearly one-third of family caregivers are in distress, an increase of 3.4 per cent in the past five years, because they are not getting enough respite. Forewell often felt the pressure of trying to get help so she could better care for her husband, Vince, whose dementia made him a challenging patient. By last summer, Vince’s dementia had progressed to the point that he was incontinent, easily agitated, and constantly trying to escape from their home. Forewell was desperate for respite, but Vince was twice rejected from health-authority run daycare programs which his wife maintains should have had the expertise to handle his behaviour. She turned to two doctors who had been treating Vince, and both recommended to the health authority that he be placed in long-term care, but this was denied, Forewell said. A short time later, Vince was admitted to Burnaby General Hospital, where he stayed for three weeks before finally being placed in long-term care. He died a week later. Forewell tried her best, but is haunted by the thought of whether she could have made Vince’s final months better had she received the help she needed. “I truly hope that changes in a very broken system can happen,” Forewell said in her letter to the seniors advocate. “I’m sure you have all of our best interests at heart and I also realize it takes time to change things. However, many of us do not have a lot of time left so I feel there should be a sense of urgency in your efforts.” lculbert@postmedia.com Twitter:@loriculbert With files from Pamela Fayerman, Kevin Griffin and Randy Shore, Postmedia Postmedia’s 2018 seven-part series: Part 1:How the system works (or doesn’t) Part 2:Wait times long for residential care Part 3:Home care support stretched thin Part 4:The problems with residential care Part 5:Food and nutrition in residential care Part 6:Challenges for relatives providing care Part 7:Dementia patients and the B.C. system"
194,"Jul 04, 2019","Health Minister Adrian Dix says seniors going into nursing homes will no longer be forced to grab and move into the first available bed because as of July 15, they will be allowed to choose from their three preferred care homes. The first-available-bed-policy was established 17 years ago and compelled families to make almost instantaneous decisions or risk losing the bed and sinking down the waiting list. Dix said families will now have up to three days to decide whether to take the available bed in one of the three preferred care facilities. “This is one of the most challenging decisions in someone’s life, so it’s important they choose a care home that works for them,” Dix said during the announcement outside the B.C. legislature on Wednesday. While waiting for a bed in a facility of their choice, people can either stay at home, with additional care, or go to an interim facility without losing their spot on the waiting list for a preferred facility, Dix said. Through a system of improved transparency, individuals will get more information about waiting times to any one of their preferred facilities. Historically, nursing-home clients have usually not been placed in a preferred bed in some regions such as Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health. “The Ministry of Health is making changes to give people more flexibility in choosing their preferred care home, give them more time to make these important decisions and provide them with the information they need to make an informed choice,” said Dix. Daniel Fontaine, CEO of the B.C. Care Providers Association, said the changes have long been necessary and “will go a long way in giving seniors more choice in the care they received.” He said another change being made that Dix didn’t mention at the news conference has to do with terminology.The government is revising the Home and Community Care Policy Manual to move away from the term “residential care” because it’s considered by some First Nations to be culturally inappropriate. The term to be used now when referring to such facilities is “long-term care,” Fontaine said. About 10,000 B.C. residents are admitted to care each year. The government funds about 28,000 residential care beds in either government-operated or privately operated facilities. Of the 28,000 beds funded by the government, 70 per cent are owned by private companies and 30 per cent are health-authority-owned-and-operated. B.C. Senior’s Advocate Isobel Mackenzie was influential in the changes announced Wednesday as was the Ombudsman’s office. The Senior’s Advocate office offers anonline searchable database of care homeswith information that helps families learn about any quality of care and safety issues. Changes announced by Dix will also require facilities to obtain consent for admission to a care facility. If an individual moving into a facility is incapable of giving consent for medical reasons, then a substitute decision-maker will. And if there is no such person, the Public Guardian and Trustee will step in. Meanwhile, controversy continues to rage in Prince George over the abrupt closure of a private care facility. Nine frail, elderly patients were told they had to move out last week after the facility operators were told they were understaffed. Some residents, like 91-year-old Kay Gable, were transferred by ambulance from the Enat Complex Care facility to hospital overnight for lack of any available beds in other care facilities. Other residents went elsewhere. Gable’s son Kirk said Wednesday that his mom and eight other elderly individuals have now been moved yet again to an overcapacity Northern Health-region owned-and-operated facility called Gateway Lodge. “They’ve turned activity rooms into makeshift bedrooms, but, of course, there are no bathrooms.There are five other facilities in Prince George, but they are all full and have long wait lists. So I don’t know when my mother will be moved yet again, or where,” he said. Gable said he finds it “despicable” that the small, private facility for which his mother was paying $5,200 a month was forced to shut down because the government deemed it to be understaffed. The owners — a couple from Ethiopia — are recent immigrants with recognized nursing credentials but the health authority said they needed to have more nurses and care aides on staff. The facility’s owner, Eyobe Abebe, couldn’t be reached for comment, but he previously told CBC that he couldn’t afford to operate the facility anymore with the new demands of a 24-hour registered nurse, another licensed practical nurse and another two care aides, on top of the three aides already there. Eryn Collins, spokeswoman for Northern Health, said: “We are continuing to explore options and plan for their care and are communicating directly with residents and their families about their interim location and care, and the plans going forward.” Gable said he’s perplexed because Northern Health had recommended the facility for his mom after his dad died recently. There was no advance warning of staffing problems or an imminent closure, he said. pfayerman@postmedia.com Twitter:@MedicineMatters READ MORE: https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/caring-for-our-elders-a-primer-on-the-system"
195,"Jun 22, 2019","The first time it happened, Manon Eburne was surprised. As she came out of the Pitt Meadows retirement home where she volunteers, she noticed the words “No Parking” scrawled across her passenger window in yellow ink. But she was able to remove the tag with “a little elbow grease” and didn’t think too much about it. When it happened again, Eburne was confused. She went to the municipal hall to ask if she was allowed to park on 119b Avenue outside the Wesbrooke retirement home. “I thought maybe I had missed something,” she said Saturday, 18 months after her car was tagged the first time. A bylaw officer visited the site and confirmed she was in compliance with parking regulations. Eburne and her husband were away for part of the winter. When they returned, she resumed volunteering two to three times a week at the Wesbrooke. The vandal resumed his or her work, too. Eburne, a retired RCMP officer, was no longer surprised or confused — now, she was mad. “I’m on a mission,” she said. “This summer, I am going to find out who is doing this. It has to stop.” Eburne knows — both from her discussions with the Ridge Meadows RCMP and her own experience as an officer — that she will need to catch the perpetrator in the act. Last week, she posted a question on a Facebook group asking for advice on video camera equipment. In response, several members of the group posted they also had their cars tagged while parked in the same place on 119b Avenue. One was visiting her grandmother at the time. Eburne has no interest in vigilantism or “plugging up our already plugged-up court system,” she said. She’s simply tired of washing her windows with nail polish remover every week, and she wants to park in peace. Parking in a different place is out of the question. “What they are doing is not right,” she said. “We are going to figure out what the issue is, and we’re going to address it. If we have to go to the municipal hall together, we will do that.” Eburne has been volunteering at the retirement home for about five years. She knits and makes crafts with the residents and helps out at special events. She cares about her community and knew many of the residents before they moved into the home. “I joined the RCMP to help people and make a difference, and volunteering is a continuation of that,” she said.

196,"Jun 19, 2019","The provincial home care program is not meeting the needs of most seniors, according to a report Wednesday by theOffice of the Seniors Advocate. Home Support: We Can Do Betterfound that complaints about home care have increased 62 per cent in the past five years. It also found that about 4,200 long-term care beds are occupied by seniors who could live in the community with home support or in assisted living situations. Each person in a long-term care home costs taxpayers $28,000 a year. Isobel Mackenzie, the seniors advocate, said that 61 per cent of seniors admitted to long-term care received no home support in the 90 days before their admission. “The question is why? Why are we not seeing the uptake of home support that we would expect from seniors before they move into long term care?” Mackenzie said. “Well, the biggest reasons appear to be cost. We are charging our seniors too much for their provincial home support program.” B.C.is not only one of the few provinces to charge for home support, it’s the most expensive of all provinces that do, she said. “We have set up a perverse incentive system where we’re charging seniors more for something that costs the taxpayers less to provide,” she said at a news conference in Victoria. “As a consequence, what we’re seeing is seniors moving into long-term care prematurely in many cases because of economic circumstances. What we see here is a system that is woefully, woefully under servicing clients and distressed family care givers.” Mackenzie’s top recommendation to makehome supportaffordable for all seniors is for the Ministry of Health to remove the financial barriers of the current payment system. She also recommends that provincial health authorities develop a standardized care plan, and that support for family caregivers include at least eight hours of respite care a week if required. A senior with an income of $28,000, based on the daily rate copayment, would have to pay $8,800 a year, or 33 per cent of their income for home care. The average monthly subsidy for a long-term care home resident is $4,641, while the cost of two hours of home support daily is $2,312. Failing to address home care support problems leads to overburdened family caregivers, premature placement of seniors in long-term care, and increasing lengths of stay in hospital, the report says. A more effective program, Mackenzie said, could save taxpayers “millions of dollars each year.” The report also found the number of family caregivers in distress is almost one-third, an increase of 3.4 per cent in the past five years. Responding to the report, the Liberals accused Premier John Horgan and the NDP of causing a “service gap” for seniors because of changes in 2018 that have prevented community health workers from applying to work in B.C. from out of province. “There is a shortage of qualified care workers in B.C. and we need to recruit from other provinces in order to ensure our seniors get the quality care they deserve,” Linda Reid, the Liberals seniors’ care critic, said in a news release. In 2018, the provincial government introduced legislation to bring non-clinical health care workers and care aides into the B.C. Labour Code and to ban contracting out. In 2003-2004, after the Liberal government passed the two bills that excluded workers from the code. It allowed contract flipping which meant unionized workers to be fired and rehired at lower wages and weaker contracts. By early afternoon, NDP Health Minister Adrian Dix had not yet responded to Mackenzie’s report. As Mackenzie’s report points out, home care support for many seniors is provided by a spouse or adult children, who help with activities such as dressing and bathing and/or shopping and housekeeping. It’s also called family caregiving, informal care or unpaid caregiving. “Regardless of the term used to describe the assistance, the amount of care family and friends provide is fundamental to assisting frail seniors to remain living independently,” the report says. During the past 50 years, the home support program has changed significantly, the report says. It had operated as a kind of centralized homemaker service that focused on providing social support and help with intermittent activities such as shopping and housekeeping. More recently, it’s shifted to concentrate on providing personal care such as bathing and preparing meals as well as certain nursing tasks. One of the stories told to the seniors advocate involved an 84-year-old woman with mild dementia who lives at home and was scheduled for knee replacement surgery. Since policy doesn’t allow forhome supportfor elective surgery, the woman’s daughter couldn’t make arrangements for her post-operative care so had to leave her in hospital for longer than necessary. “There is an overall theme of a system-driven approach that is focused on individual tasks and inflexible policies rather than looking at the whole picture and fundamentally understanding the totality of what is required to live independently,” the report says. kevingriffin@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

197,"Jun 18, 2019","It is likely to be another hot, smoke-filled summer in B.C. this year, and residents should consider taking precautions such as staying indoors on hazy days, experts are warning. B.C. Wildfire Service information shows the province has seen increased drought and higher-than-average temperatures in 2019, and that trend is expected to continue. “Obviously, we expect increased wildfire and smoke risk, and that includes in the southwest, where (Metro Vancouver is). And increased temperatures are likely to drive higher ozone formation, and so we expect there may be more potential for that this summer as well,” Metro Vancouver air-quality engineer Francis Ries said Tuesday. Ozone, a pollutant that when mixed with fine particulate matter creates smog, often irritates the eyes, nose and throat, and over time can cause permanent lung damage. Ries said more studies, including ones that focus on B.C., are making a strong link between climate change and the exacerbation of wildfire seasons. “As we continue to see further warming, we expect that the patterns we are seeing now are likely to continue or perhaps even get more extreme,” he said. The summers of 2017 and 2018 were the worst on record for smoky skies across B.C. In Metro Vancouver, there were 22 days last July and August that were under air-quality advisories, three more than in the summer of 2017. The last two summers have far exceeded the number of advisories issued in any other year since 1996, the first year for which data is available. Several years, including 2016, had zero air-quality advisories. In 2018, B.C.’s first advisory was issued in late July. Ries said it was impossible to predict if that will happen earlier during this drier, hotter 2019. “It’s very hard for anyone to predict exactly where and when these fires will break out. It depends a lot on not just how dry it is but to what degree we see some highly connected activities,” he said, such as thunderstorms or careless activities, which include discarding a lit cigarette or leaving a campfire unattended. “(But) we certainly don’t want to go into this predicted drier-than-usual summer thinking we’d see something different than we have the last few years.” This summer, like the previous two, experts are warnings people to take caution when outside, especially those with asthma, lung conditions, the elderly and pregnant women. When air-quality bulletins are issued, all residents are reminded to try to stay indoors, especially in places with filtered air — such as some community centres, malls and libraries. Wearing a face mask is not the most reliable way to try to keep smoke out of your lungs during wildfire season, said Vancouver Coastal Health medical health officer Dr. James Lu. An air cleaner can be purchased and set up in a room to try to keep a house as smoke-free as possible. lculbert@postmedia.com Twitter:@loriculbert"
198,"Jun 16, 2019","From Doris Hunter’s perspective in an electric wheelchair, Vancouver looks much different than it does to someone who’s able-bodied. When out in the city, Hunter is always looking for the location of curb cuts — the ramps in the curb creating a smooth transition from sidewalk to street for people in wheelchairs and using strollers. “This one isn’t too bad,” Hunter said about the curb cut at the northeast corner of Dunbar and 41st Avenue on the city’s west side. Hunter was part of a “street audit” along 41st Avenue that evaluates areas based on their walkability and wheelability. It took place recently duringWalk and Wheel Friendly Dunbar, which concluded on Sunday. The six-page audit evaluated a section of the corridor in Dunbar from the point of view of safety for people on foot, in wheelchairs and with mobility challenges before changes are made for theproposed 41st Avenue B-Linebus service. Hunter estimated she uses the bus six days out of seven, mainly in Dunbar and Kerrisdale, for outings that include going to medical appointments and picking up her grandchildren from school. She said she’s worried about proposed changes that will mean theremoval of parking next to the curb in some blocks. In the shopping area east of Dunbar, a lane of parked cars separated her on the sidewalk and traffic on 41st. “I find that the cars are a buffer,” she said. “You’re not really scared, even with buses coming by every five or six minutes.” Later on, Hunter was farther east along 41st Avenue by Kerrisdale elementary. A pedestrian decided to step onto the street instead of passing her on the narrow sidewalk. Hunter said the city and TransLink need to hold neighbourhood meetings to counter any rumours and misinformation about the new B-Line service. “I think there is a real need to get answers before things are done,” she said. “They should do it early. Now is the time. “ Andrea Sara, chair of the transportation committee for theDunbar Residents’ Association, accompanied Hunter on the street audit. She said the main takeaways were that intersections need bigger corner bulges to slow turning vehicles and narrow sidewalks need to be widened. On the plus side are the wide sidewalks on some blocks such as the retail area on the south side of 41st Avenue. They provide the city with space to improve public amenities, she said. “Maybe out of what we do today, someone will read this and see pictures and it will make them think: ‘I have to slow down. There are others I’m sharing the road with that don’t move as quickly and don’t have a big body of metal around them.’ ” Part of the challenge, Sara pointed out, is that many of the sidewalks and streetscapes along 41st Avenue in Dunbar were designed for a different era and don’t fit with 21st-century approaches to urbanism. “What are the issues that we all need to be aware of to make neighbourhoods more walkable or wheelable?” she asked. TransLink wants a new 41st Avenue B-Lineto connect Joyce-Collingwood Station on the Expo Line to the University of B.C. It’s designed to be a faster service than the 43 Express bus that it will replace. kevingriffin@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo. Is there more to this story?

199,"May 27, 2019","One in five Canadians lives with chronic pain, but the cries of an estimated 800,000 British Columbians are not only being ignored, their suffering is being exacerbated by regulators limiting their access to both drugs and treatment. First, in a move unprecedented in North America, the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons imposed mandatory opioid and narcotic prescription limits on doctors in 2016 in an attempt to avoid creating additional addicts and having more prescription drugs sold on the street. Physicians who don’t comply can be fined up to $100,000 or have their licences revoked. Now, the college is setting tough regulations for physicians administering pain-management injections. “I’m enraged,” says Kate Mills, a 33-year-old, palliative care nurse who has been on disability leave for the past 18 months. “People like me are living in chronic, intractable pain and being ignored by doctors who are either too scared or too callous to care.” She has an uncommon, congenital condition that causes chronic inflammation near her sacroiliac joint and in her lower back, which pushes down on her nerves causing “exquisite pain” down her leg. Her first doctor essentially fired her, refusing to treat the pain. The next one prescribed Oxycodone to help Mills through until she was able to receive a steroid injection at a clinic, which kept the pain in check for several months. But by the time the injection’s effects were wearing off, her GP went on extended medical leave. The locum assigned to Mills refused to prescribe her any medication and told her to go to an emergency room where she was given a prescription. After numerous ER visits, Mills finally found a doctor two weeks ago who is willing to provide medication for her between injections. But he agreed only after Mills signed a contract agreeing that she won’t sell the drugs, will only go to one pharmacy and take the drugs only as prescribed. She is lucky, though. Her pain management clinic will likely meet the college’s new standards that were developed by an advisory panel over the past three years out of concern about patient safety. “Increasingly,” the college says on its website, “Procedural pain management is being provided in private clinics and physician offices, but without much guidance on appropriate credentials, settings, techniques and equipment.” The new regulations would require physicians’ offices or clinics to become accredited facilities with standards on par with ambulatory surgery centres. That means having tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of equipment including resuscitation carts, high-resolution ultrasound, automated external defibrillators and electronic cardiograms with printout capability. The college acknowledges that “patients do not require continuous ECG monitoring. However, the cardiac monitoring equipment must be available in the event a patient has an unintended reaction to the procedure.” The disruption for patients will be huge, according to Dr. Helene Bertrand, a general practitioner, pain researcher and clinical instructor at UBC’s medical school. She estimates that up to 80 per cent of the offices and clinics where the injections are currently being done won’t measure up and already wait times are up to 18 months. When the new requirements come into force, Bertrand predicts patients will be waiting anywhere from four to seven years for treatment. Bertrand herself will have to quit doing prolotherapy, which she has done for the past 18 years on everything from shoulders to necks to spine to ankles. That’s despite the fact she’s never been sued, never had a complaint filed with the college and has published, peer-reviewed research that revealed an 89 per cent success rate among 211 patients in her study group. (Prolotherapy involves injecting a sugar solution close to injured or painful joints causing inflammation. That inflammation increases the blood supply and deposits collagen on tendons and ligaments helping to repair them.) The college will not grandfather general practitioners already doing injection therapies. Instead it will restrict general practitioners to knees, ankles and shoulders. All other joint injections must be done by anesthetists or pain specialists. For Joan Bellamy, that’s a huge step backward. She’s suffered from chronic pain since 1983 and “undergone the gamut of medical approaches, often with excessive waits: hospital OP (outpatient), pharmacology, neurology, orthopedics, spinal, physiatry and private.” Since 2000, she’s had multiple injections that have made a difference. But her doctor doesn’t meet the new qualifications. “I am afraid that without her expertise … that pain will become an intolerable burden, and any search for treatment will result in inconceivable wait times and will debilitate me,” Bellamy wrote in a letter to the college and copied to me. The near future for pain-sufferers looks grim with most physicians able to offer them little more than over-the-counter painkillers. Ironically at a time when the provincial medical health officer and others are lobbying hard to have all drugs legalized so that addicts have access to a safe supply, chronic pain-sufferers are being marginalized. For them, it’s more difficult than ever to get what they need. It’s forcing many of them facing a lifetime of exquisite and unbearable pain to at least contemplate one of two deadly choices: Buy potentially fentanyl-laced street drugs; or worse, ask for medically assisted dying. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter.com/Bramham_daphne CLICK HEREto report a typo.

200,"May 14, 2019","If you want to save your brain, focus on keeping the rest of your body well with exercise and healthy habits rather than popping vitamin pills, new guidelines for preventing dementia advise. About 50 million people currently have dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type. Each year brings 10 million new cases, says the report released Tuesday by the World Health Organization. Although age is the top risk factor, “dementia is not a natural or inevitable consequence of aging,” it says. Many health conditions and behaviours affect the odds of developing it, and research suggests that a third of cases are preventable, said Maria Carrillo, chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Association, which has published similar advice . Since dementia is currently incurable and so many experimental therapies have failed, focusing on prevention may “give us more benefit in the shorter term,” Carrillo said. Much of the WHO’s advice is common sense, and echoes what the U.S. National Institute on Aging says . That includes getting enough exercise; treating other health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol; having an active social life, and avoiding or curbing harmful habits such as smoking, overeating and drinking too much alcohol. Evidence is weak that some of these help preserve thinking skills, but they’re known to aid general health, the WHO says. Eating well, and possibly following a Mediterranean-style diet, may help prevent dementia, the guidelines say. But they take a firm stance against vitamin B or E pills, fish oil or multi-complex supplements that are promoted for brain health because there’s strong research showing they don’t work. “There is currently no evidence to show that taking these supplements actually reduces the risk of cognitive decline and dementia, and in fact, we know that in high doses these can be harmful,” said the WHO’s Dr. Neerja Chowdhary. “People should be looking for these nutrients through food … not through supplements,” Carrillo agreed. The WHO also did not endorse games and other activities aimed at boosting thinking skills. These can be considered for people with normal capacities or mild impairment, but there’s low to very low evidence of benefit. There’s not enough evidence to recommend antidepressants to reduce dementia risk although they may be used to treat depression, the report says. Hearing aids also may not reduce dementia risk, but older people should be screened for hearing loss and treated accordingly. —— Follow Marilynn Marchione on Twitter: @MMarchioneAP —— The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

201,"May 11, 2019","Where does your testosterone come from? If you answered “my testicles” you’d be pretty much right, though a small amount comes from your adrenal glands, too. And if you’re female, your ovaries make most of your testosterone. Ah, but where does your testosterone level come from? Scientists have generally believed that, in the absence of disease, race and genetics were probably the major determinants of how much testosterone is coursing through your body. Now, scientists have determined that other factors help to establish a set point for your adult testosterone levels. One of them is where you grew up and what stresses you were exposed to as a child. Researchers led by Kesson Magid at Durham University in the U.K. studied 359 men, collecting data such as height, weight, age of the onset of puberty, and testosterone level. They compared men with different life histories. The most interesting findings came when they compared men who migrated from Bangladesh to the U.K. as children with men who arrived in adulthood or who stayed in Bangladesh. Males who moved from Bangladesh to Britain in childhood had significantly higher testosterone levels, and reached puberty earlier, than comparable men who stayed in Bangladesh. The authors theorize that testosterone production is sort of a luxury good. It happens after the body has taken care of more urgent demands on its energy such as fighting off infections. They write that “We consider childhood exposure to disease within Bangladesh, as well as the experience of migration itself, as the most plausible causes of the observed variation.” Men who migrated to the U.K. as adults did not show this effect, so it seems to relate to childhood experiences. For this study, the researchers used saliva samples, but the normal testosterone test your doctor can order involves a blood sample. One would think that the recently announced online health records portal provided by Alberta Health would let you check your testosterone levels in the privacy of your own home. However, while other endocrine tests like TSH and T4, which relate to the thyroid gland, are displayed, it looks like you’ll have to sit down with your doctor to get your serum testosterone results. This may be a good thing, because there are a lot of factors that can influence your testosterone levels, and a lot of commercially inspired half truths floating around. The Mayo Clinic, which is a highly credible source of health information, has an article called Testosterone Therapy: Risks and Benefits as You Age posted on their website. The article notes that “As you get older, testosterone therapy may sound like the ultimate anti-aging formula.” Their experts say that it’s important to know if reduced testosterone levels are symptoms of a disease called hypogonadism, or simply the result of aging. Testosterone levels decline naturally, about one per cent per year, starting around age 30 to 40. Low testosterone levels can be the cause of changes in sexual function, sleep disturbances, reduced muscle mass and increased body fat, and emotional changes including depression. Only a physician can tell you if you might benefit from testosterone therapy, which can take the form of injections, gels or patches. Having testosterone levels that are too high or too low can be problematic. High readings predispose you to increased and more aggressive prostate disease. Advertisers trying to sell testosterone boosters have told us all about the dreaded effects of what they call “Low T” which include erectile dysfunction, loss of libido and low energy. There are, of course, possible side-effects to boosting your testosterone levels chemically. These include everything from reoccurrence of your teenage acne to enlarged man breasts and, in serious cases, a deep vein thrombosis, which might kill you. So TRT (testosterone replacement therapy) is not something you should embark on lightly, and certainly not because you watched a video on the Internet urging you to call a 1-800 number right now to get boundless energy and legendary abilities in the bedroom. There are some natural, drug-free ways to boost testosterone levels. These include shedding a few pounds and doing resistance exercises with dumbbells, elastic bands, or gym machines. Those help to build muscle mass which promotes testosterone levels. The work coming out of Durham University on childhood stress and testosterone levels almost certainly has relevance to Canada. Children raised in stressful homes, or in the unsanitary conditions that are found in some remote communities, might have the same challenges as the youth in Bangladesh. On the flip side, child migrants who come to Canada from developing countries may experience a boost in testosterone levels and earlier puberty which might pose cultural challenges. If you have any concerns about your testosterone levels, your doctor, and not the Internet, is you go to place for reliable and personalized information.

202,"May 04, 2019","The stories people tell these days about how they struggle to support an elderly loved one are heartbreaking. We often hear about family members sacrificing vacation time or taking sick days to look after an aging parent. In instances like these, relief can come in the form of a publicly funded support worker who seniors trust to enter their home, often when they are at their most vulnerable. However, changes recently announced by the NDP government could bring service disruptions and put home-care services at risk in B.C.’s most populated health regions. The government’s plan requires laying off more than 4,000 unionized home-support workers currently working for six contracted non-government agencies and then offering them positions in government-run health authorities with matching salaries and benefits. Sadly, the future is less certain for hundreds of non-unionized employees who were not factored into the government’s plan. During this transition, Health Minister Adrian Dix says his goal is that existing clients won’t see any change. The Seniors’ Advocate echoed the minister, saying the plan will be “a success if (clients) don’t notice any difference.” If more of the same is the goal, then the public should ask why the government is making this massive expansion of the public service. What we know is that the government’s plan was cooked up behind closed doors, with seniors and other key stakeholders kept in the dark. Had seniors been consulted, they would tell government that they want expanded home-support services and longer visit times. In February 2017, the federal government did respond to growing demand by committing $785 million in new funding over 10 years toward home and community care in B.C. Yet, in spite of the federal funding coming over two years ago, seniors have not seen any significant changes in service. With so much uncertainty around the government’s home-care plan, seniors as well as their family caregivers have reason to be anxious. Right out of the gate the cost differential for these changes is estimated to be as much as 25 per cent higher for the exact same level of service, during a time when health-care costs are already skyrocketing. This alone should be a red flag for all British Columbians. In addition to increased taxpayer burden, there are significant concerns about the loss of capacity resulting from scheduling changes. The government’s proposed plan will require more staff than is currently available. Shortage of staff is understood to be the biggest crisis facing the continuing care sector. The changes to home support not only fail to address the staff shortages, they could actually make the problem much worse. Health care is not like the National Hockey League, where you just bring additional players up from a farm team. There are simply not enough workers. Then there are additional concerns about whether the government has thought through the impact of union seniority. By merging more than 4,000 staff represented by multiple unions into the health authorities all at once, the chain reaction around workers’ “bumping rights” could take months or even years to sort out. This means seniors risk losing a connection to a care provider they have got to know and trust. By choosing to shut out non-profit societies and organizations that have provided services here for decades, the B.C. government is putting politics ahead of good public policy. It is not too late for the NDP to rethink its plan and conduct a meaningful consultation around home care. For seniors and overstretched family members feeling the brunt, that conversation cannot come soon enough. Daniel Fontaine is CEO of the B.C. Care Providers Association.

203,"Apr 30, 2019","WASHINGTON — Some people told they have Alzheimer’s may instead have a newly identified mimic of the disease — and scientists say even though neither is yet curable, it’s critical to get better at telling different kinds of dementia apart. Too often, the word dementia is used interchangeably with Alzheimer’s when there are multiple types of brain degeneration that can harm people’s memory and thinking skills. “Not everything that looks like Alzheimer’s disease is Alzheimer’s disease,” said Dr. Julie Schneider, a neuropathologist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. And among all the known dementias, this newly identified kind “is the most striking mimic of Alzheimer’s,” she added. It’s not clear how many people have this particular type, which an international team of scientists defined Tuesday in the journal Brain. But there could be a sizeable number, said Dr. Peter Nelson of the University of Kentucky, the paper’s lead author. The dementia was dubbed “LATE,” an acronym chosen in part because the oldest seniors seem at greatest risk. Here’s a look at various dementias in the confusing Alzheimer’s-or-not mix: SCIENTISTS STUMBLED ONTO NEWEST DISORDER Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, and autopsies have long found its telltale signs in the brain: sticky plaque from an abnormal buildup of amyloid protein, and tangles of another protein named tau. Only recently have scientists developed special, pricey scans that can measure that buildup in living brains. Then studies with those scans found about a third of people with Alzheimer’s symptoms lack amyloid buildup — ruling out Alzheimer’s, said Schneider, senior author of Tuesday’s paper. What else could cause their dementia? ANOTHER TOXIC PROTEIN FOUND It turns out another protein, named TDP-43, also can run amok in the brain. Scientists knew it plays a role in a completely different disorder, Lou Gehrig’s disease. Then, they linked TDP-43 buildup to severe shrinking of the hippocampus, a brain region key for learning and memory. Nelson said about a quarter of people over age 85 have enough abnormal TDP-43 to affect their memory or thinking abilities. For now, it takes an autopsy to spot — the symptoms seem like Alzheimer’s until a specialist can peer inside the brain. “What is now clear is that a lot of dementia is caused by gloppy proteins. We used to think it was just two gloppy proteins, amyloid and tau,” Nelson said. The next step: Finding better ways to measure abnormal TDP-43 and diagnose LATE. (It stands for an unwieldy scientific name — Limbic-predominant Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy.) “Our ultimate goal is to test people hopefully in a very noninvasive way,” said National Institute on Aging dementia specialist Nina Silverberg. That’s key to eventually developing treatments. OTHER CULPRITS ALSO ARE OVERLOOKED — Strokes, sometimes small “silent” ones, can trigger what’s called vascular dementia, something scientists at the National Institutes of Health think might be prevented with better blood pressure control. — Lewy body dementia, named for clumps of still another abnormal protein, can cause Alzheimer’s-like symptoms along with movement and other problems. — Frontotemporal dementia often triggers changes in personality and tends to strike at a younger age than Alzheimer’s, yet can still be misdiagnosed. Many older patients probably have “mixed dementia,” several brain changes that combine to cause trouble, Dr. Walter Koroshetz, head of NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, told a recent meeting about non-Alzheimer’s dementias. Tuesday’s paper about TDP-43-caused disease adds to the complexity, said Alzheimer’s Association chief science officer Maria Carrillo, who wasn’t involved with the new research. “We must learn more about each contributing cause of dementia so we can understand how these changes begin and interact and co-occur, and how to best diagnose, treat and prevent them,” she said. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO TELL ONE DEMENTIA FROM ANOTHER? Current treatments for Alzheimer’s and other dementias temporarily ease symptoms. But there are other reasons for a precise diagnosis. A list of medications common for seniors can harm people with Lewy body dementia, for example. Knowing the specifics also can help people plan care, as some types of dementia worsen faster than others. And it’s critical for developing better dementia treatments. Testing a treatment that targets, say, the tau tangles or amyloid plaques of Alzheimer’s won’t stand a chance if patients who only have TDP-43 are allowed into the study. “If you have a dementia percolating in your brain, the only hope we have right now is to participate in a clinical trial to try to stop it,” Nelson said. —— The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

204,"Apr 26, 2019","Gail Jardine says it’s a bit like changing the channels on a television. Never has wielding a remote control, however, been so life altering. Jardine is referring to the electrodes implanted in her spine in late December, and the device that turns them on and adjusts their frequency, an experimental treatment for Parkinson’s disease being spearheaded by a Canadian team. Until a few months ago, the former school board employee would frequently freeze as she was walking – and fall over – a common and debilitating symptom of the condition. Now the so-called spinal-cord stimulation she is helping test has eliminated the problem and transformed her daily routine like “night and day.” “I walk with my husband,” said the 66-year-old London, Ont., resident Thursday. “I can go around the house without a cane. I can play with my grandkids, do all the things I used to do.” Jardine is part of research by a team at London’s Western University, which is using electrical pulses into the spine to target walking impairments that can be all but impossible to treat otherwise. Dr.Mandar Jog, the neurologist leading the work, has published justone paperinvolving the initial five patients — last May — and cautions that it is early days, far from “fixed and finished.” Other experts have noted such symptoms have a subjective element and aresusceptible to placeboeffect. But he says the results to date have been surprisingly promising, making dramatic improvements in many of the patients enrolled in his trials. Two who had been housebound and reliant on wheelchairs went on vacations under their own steam — one leaving his wife in tears at the change — while others have eliminated repeated falls that can have disastrous effects. “We’re not making people run the Boston Marathon, that’s not the idea,” Jog said. “We’re not curing the disease, but … even getting people to not fall is a big deal for them.” Parkinson’s occurs in people whose brains fail to produce enough dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells and controls movement. The result can be tremors, slowness and stiffness, impaired balance and rigidity, among other symptoms. Even getting people to not fall is a big deal Treatments include drugs that spur dopamine production and, for less than 10 per cent of patients, deep-brain stimulation, where electrodes are implanted in the brain. But the drugs do little for gait problems such as those Jardine had, and deep-brain stimulation can actually make them worse, Jog said. Scientists working with Parkinson’s-suffering rodents and primates had reported good results with spinal-cord stimulation as long as a decade ago. Yet researchers were slow to follow up with human trials, leaving one leader in that science, Duke University’s Miguel Nicolelis, “frustrated that people haven’t really trusted his work,” Jog said. The Canadian and his colleagues at Western’s Lawson Health Research Institute are among a few teams worldwide to experiment in people. With an out-patient procedure that takes about an hour, electrodes are implanted in the spine. Patients use the “remote control” to adjust the frequency, as well as turn on and off the generator when they wake in the morning and at night . Jog says his research suggests the jolts of electricity in effect “reawaken” or trigger established walking patterns. The study uses sensor-based technology to objectively measure changes. The paper published last year on the original five subjects reported improvements after six months in step length and speed, ability to stand up from sitting position and confidence in walking. And freezing of gait — known among neurologists by the evocative acronym FOG — was all but eliminated. Five years after those pioneers were first treated, one has died, one saw improvements taper off after three and a half years, but the other three continue to enjoy the changes, Jog said. Still, there are skeptics. In aletter to the journalthat published the Western paper, Dr. Erich Talamoni Fonoff of Brazil’s University of Sao Paulo acknowledged the idea’s promise but noted “it is well known that some PD symptoms can improve remarkably with placebo.” Freezing of gait, in particular, is highly influenced by attention, stress and environmental distractions, he said. Fonoff called for double-blind trials, in which a control group of patients receives a dummy procedure to compare against the real treatment. Jog admits it’s theoretically possible his subjects have been experiencing a placebo effect, but said randomized controlled trials would be difficult to properly conduct with the spinal-stimulation technology. And, he suggested, the placebo issue is of questionable relevance if patients continue to do well years later. Meanwhile, his team is also trying spinal-cord stimulation on another 10 Parkinson’s patient and on people with other movement disorders, such as progressive supranuclear palsy – for which there is virtually no treatment. It could also help the many sufferers of “vascular gait disorder,” whose movements have been impaired by mini strokes. Jardine was diagnosed 12 years ago nd eventually had to quit her job as an education analyst, stop driving and be all but housebound. “I had freezing really bad. Your feet just lock up and you just topple over,” she said. “I was fortunate I hadn’t broken anything.” Jardine is convinced that what started four months ago is much more than a mere placebo effect and sees no signs of the stimulation’s benefits wearing off. In fact, she said, “I’m feeling it more and more.” • Email:tblackwell@postmedia.com| Twitter:tomblackwellNP"

206,"Apr 11, 2019","Remember when some experts were suggesting we’d find a cure for dementia within five to seven years? Turns out that was some five to seven years ago. Clearly, a cure has proven elusive, but all is not doom and gloom. Research continues on a cure and scientists have also amassed a wealth of knowledge on how to prevent — or at least delay — the onset of dementia. We’ve learned, for example, that one way to forestall cognitive decline is to eat healthily, exercise, maintain a healthy weight and avoid vices like smoking and drinking excessively. In other words, to follow the very lifestyle that doctors have long prescribed to prevent heart disease and a raft of other deleterious conditions. When it comes to dementia, researchers are now discovering other unexpected factors that might contribute to cognitive decline, chief among them being hearing impairment. Researchers and clinicians have long known that dementia is sometimes misdiagnosed in patients suffering from hearing loss. After all, if you can’t hear the questions when completing a verbal cognition test, it’s awfully difficult to provide the right answers. However, new research suggests that hearing impairment and dementia are much more intimately related. According to a recent meta-analysis of a number of studies, older people with hearing loss experienced a significantly higher risk of developing dementia than those with normal hearing. Another recent study concluded that treatment for hearing loss might be more effective than any other intervention in preventing or delaying dementia onset. As this is a relatively new area of research, scientists don’t yet understand why hearing impairment and dementia are related, though several hypotheses are currently being tested. Social isolation may be a factor as people often isolate themselves when they develop hearing problems and isolation is correlated with numerous negative health outcomes. It’s also possible that hearing loss and dementia are both caused by a third “confounding” variable  such as brain pathology or vascular disease. Whatever the cause, public education about the potential impact of hearing impairment is crucially important given that about 50 per cent of Canadians over age 65 suffer some hearing loss. Consequently, at Providence Healthcare’s 16th Annual Geriatric Services Conference on April 12, psychologist and audiologist Kathleen Pichora-Fuller will present a free evening public lecture addressing the research on, and relationship between, hearing loss and dementia. Her discussion will cap off a day long event that brings together physicians, nurses and other health care practitioners to discuss the medical, legal and ethical aspects of aging, including dementia care. Keynote speakers include renowned New Zealand neurosurgeon and ethicist Grant Gillett, who will speak on “ethics and lived stories,” as he weaves together narratives of patients, families and caregivers. And University of Alberta nursing professor Carole Estabrooks, the Canada Research Chair in Knowledge Translation, will discuss changing stories in elder care.

207,"Apr 08, 2019","In May, an elderly man was admitted to the Brooklyn branch of Mount Sinai Hospital for abdominal surgery. A blood test revealed that he was infected with a newly discovered germ as deadly as it was mysterious. The germ, a fungus called Candida auris, preys on people with weakened immune systems, and it is quietly spreading across the globe. Recently C. auris reached New York, New Jersey and Illinois, leading the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to add it to a list of germs deemed “urgent threats.” The man at Mount Sinai died after 90 days in the hospital, but C. auris did not. Tests showed it was everywhere in his room, so invasive that the hospital needed special cleaning equipment and had to rip out some of the ceiling and floor tiles to eradicate it. C. auris is so tenacious, in part, because it is impervious to major antifungal medications, making it a new example of one of the world’s most intractable health threats: the rise of drug-resistant infections. For decades, public health experts have warned that the overuse of antibiotics was reducing the effectiveness of drugs that have lengthened life spans by curing bacterial infections once commonly fatal. But lately, there has been an explosion of resistant fungi as well. “It’s an enormous problem,” said Matthew Fisher, a professor of fungal epidemiology at Imperial College London. “We depend on being able to treat those patients with antifungals.” Simply put, fungi, just like bacteria, are evolving defenses to survive modern medicines. A study the British government funded projects that if policies are not put in place to slow the rise of drug resistance, 10 million people could die worldwide of all such infections in 2050, eclipsing the 8 million expected to die that year from cancer. We depend on being able to treat those patients with antifungals Antibiotics and antifungals are essential to combat infections in people, but antibiotics are also used widely to prevent disease in farm animals, and antifungals are also applied to prevent agricultural plants from rotting. Some scientists cite evidence that rampant use of fungicides on crops is contributing to the surge in drug-resistant fungi infecting humans. Yet as the problem grows, it is little understood by the public — in part because the very existence of resistant infections is often cloaked in secrecy. With bacteria and fungi alike, hospitals and local governments are reluctant to disclose outbreaks for fear of being seen as infection hubs. C. auris, which infected the man at Mount Sinai, is one of dozens of dangerous bacteria and fungi that have developed resistance. Yet, like most of them, it is a threat that is virtually unknown to the public. Other prominent strains of the fungus Candida — one of the most common causes of bloodstream infections in hospitals — have not developed significant resistance to drugs, but more than 90 percent of C. auris infections are resistant to at least one drug, and 30 percent are resistant to two or more drugs, the CDC said. Nearly half of patients who contract C. auris die within 90 days, according to the CDC. Yet the world’s experts have not nailed down where it came from in the first place. “It is a creature from the black lagoon,” said Dr. Tom Chiller, who heads the fungal branch at the CDC. “It bubbled up and now it is everywhere.” ‘No need’ to tell the public In late 2015, Dr. Johanna Rhodes, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London, got a panicked call from the Royal Brompton Hospital outside London. C. auris had taken root there months earlier, and the hospital couldn’t clear it.“‘We have no idea where it’s coming from. We’ve never heard of it. It’s just spread like wildfire,’” Rhodes said she was told. She agreed to help the hospital identify the fungus’ genetic profile and clean it from rooms. It was spreading, but word of it was not. The hospital, a specialty lung and heart center that draws wealthy patients from the Middle East and around Europe, alerted the British government and told infected patients, but made no public announcement. This hushed panic is playing out in hospitals around the world. Individual institutions and national, state and local governments have been reluctant to publicize outbreaks of resistant infections, arguing there is no point in scaring patients — or prospective ones. Dr. Silke Schelenz, Royal Brompton’s infectious disease specialist, found the lack of urgency from the government and hospital in the early stages of the outbreak “very, very frustrating.” “They obviously didn’t want to lose reputation,” Schelenz said. “It hadn’t impacted our surgical outcomes.” By the end of June 2016, a scientific paper reported “an ongoing outbreak of 50 C. auris cases” at Royal Brompton, and the hospital took an extraordinary step: It shut down its ICU for 11 days, again with no announcement. Days later the hospital finally acknowledged to a newspaper that it had a problem. A headline in The Daily Telegraph warned, “Intensive Care Unit Closed After Deadly New Superbug Emerges in the U.K.” Yet the issue remained little known internationally, while an even bigger outbreak had begun in Valencia, Spain, at the Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe. As with Royal Brompton, the hospital in Spain did not make any public announcement. It still has not. The secrecy infuriates patient advocates, who say people have a right to know if there is an outbreak. “Why the heck are we reading about an outbreak almost a year and a half later — and not have it front-page news the day after it happens?” said Dr. Kevin Kavanagh, chairman of Health Watch USA, a nonprofit patient advocacy group. Health officials say that disclosing outbreaks frightens patients about a situation they can do nothing about, particularly when the risks are unclear. “It’s hard enough with these organisms for health care providers to wrap their heads around it,” said Dr. Anna Yaffee, a former CDC outbreak investigator. “It’s really impossible to message to the public.” Officials in London did alert the CDC to the Royal Brompton outbreak while it was occurring. And the CDC realized it needed to get the word to U.S. hospitals. On June 24, 2016, the CDC blasted a nationwide warning and set up an email address, candidaauris@cdc.gov, to field queries. Dr. Snigdha Vallabhaneni, a key member of the fungal team, expected to get a trickle — “maybe a message every month.” Instead, within weeks, her inbox exploded. In the United States, 587 cases of people having contracted C. auris have been reported, according to the CDC. The symptoms — fever, aches and fatigue — are seemingly ordinary, but when a person gets infected, particularly someone already unhealthy, such commonplace symptoms can be fatal. The role of pesticides? As the CDC works to limit the spread of drug-resistant C. auris, its investigators have been trying to answer the vexing question: Where in the world did it come from? The first time doctors encountered C. auris was in the ear of a woman in Japan in 2009 (auris is Latin for ear). It seemed innocuous at the time, a cousin of common, easily treated fungal infections. Three years later, it appeared in an unusual test result in the lab of Dr. Jacques Meis, a microbiologist in Nijmegen, Netherlands, who was analyzing a bloodstream infection in 18 patients from four hospitals in India. Soon, new clusters of C. auris seemed to emerge with each passing month in different parts of the world. Somehow, it made a jump almost seemingly simultaneously, and seemed to spread and it is drug-resistant, which is really mind-boggling When the CDC investigators compared the entire genome of auris samples from India and Pakistan, Venezuela, South Africa and Japan, they found that its origin was not a single place, and there was not a single auris strain. The genome sequencing showed that there were four distinctive versions of the fungus, with differences so profound that they suggested that these strains had diverged thousands of years ago and emerged as resistant pathogens from harmless environmental strains in four different places at the same time. “Somehow, it made a jump almost seemingly simultaneously, and seemed to spread and it is drug-resistant, which is really mind-boggling,” Vallabhaneni said. There are different theories as to what happened with C. auris. Meis, the Dutch researcher, said he believed that drug-resistant fungi were developing thanks to heavy use of fungicides on crops. Meis became intrigued by resistant fungi when he heard about the case of a 63-year-old patient in the Netherlands who died in 2005 from a fungus called Aspergillus. It proved resistant to a front-line antifungal treatment called itraconazole. That drug is a virtual copy of the azole pesticides that are used to dust crops the world over. Chiller of the CDC theorizes that C. auris may have benefited from the heavy use of fungicides. His idea is that C. auris actually has existed for thousands of years, a not particularly aggressive bug. But as azoles began destroying more prevalent fungi, an opportunity arrived for C. auris to enter the breach. The mystery of C. auris’ emergence remains unsolved, and its origin seems, for the moment, to be less important than stopping its spread."
208,"Apr 07, 2019","At first, David Mallory thought riding an electric bike was the equivalent of cheating. Things started to change when his wife Deb bought one about nine years ago. She decided it was the best way to conquer the hill to their home on West 10th in Vancouver. As she zoomed up the hill, Mallory remembers pedalling on his 21-speed bike as fast as he could, trying to catch her. She won every time. So he took her bike for a ride. When he engaged the motor, he felt like he was defying gravity. Mallory was hooked. “It’s hard to believe I’ve had an electric bike for that long — since 2011,” he said. “Not once have I gone: ‘I wish I hadn’t bought a bike.’ I would never go back to a regular bike. It’s just so much more fun.” The experience Mallory and his wife have had with their electric bike isn’t unusual in Metro Vancouver. As the number of cyclists riding bicycles for commuting and recreation continues to increase, the kind of bikes they are using is also changing. More people than ever are riding electric bicycles, which also have functional pedals. Both David and Deb are 63 and very active. Not only do they ride their e-bikes, they swim, play tennis and golf. David has become particularly conscious of the importance of staying active as a way to keep his symptoms of multiple sclerosis at bay. This year, for example, he couldn’t wait for the snow to melt so he could use bigger panniers (a pair of bags or containers) on his bike to carry groceries. He estimates he has ridden 200 km this year — including a couple of trips to Richmond. The Mallories have just upgraded their bikes to new German-madeKalkhoffbikes fromCit-E-Cycles. They bought them on sale for about $4,000. “You see a lot of older people, a lot of seniors, riding electric bikes,” said Mallory, who retired five years ago on disability. “We ride as much as we can. We’ll ride to Granville Island to pick up something and come back. It’s really been a huge thing for us.” The growth in the sale of electric bikes around the world is the “largest and most rapid uptake of alternative-fuelled vehicles in the history of motorization,” according to the Transport Reviews articleE-bikes in the mainstream. China leads the world in e-bike sales, followed by Netherlands and Germany. In 10 years, more than 150 million e-bikes have been sold worldwide. The articleconcluded that since market penetration is low in most countries, there is little evidence to suggest that the sale of electric bikes will slow in coming years. One example of the growth in e-bikes in Metro Vancouver isCit-E-Cycles. Since opening its first location in 2011, the company has expanded to four outlets in Vancouver, Surrey, Langley and Victoria. Doug Sutton, sales and service manager at the West Broadway store, said e-bike technology has improved in the past few years. A big part of the market used to be conversion kits to adapt regular bikes to electric bikes. More recently, the location of motors has moved from the front or back wheels to the centre of the bike, which provides power to the wheel via the chain drive. Batteries have become more efficient as well. The top price for an electric bike in his store is $10,000, although Sutton said he recently had a special order for a $20,000 bike. He said the sweet spot for most e-bike sales is between $3,500 and $5,000. Everyone from grandparents to college students are buying e-bikes, he said. One growing segment is parents buying large, extended “cargo” bikes to pick up their children from school. “Most people are looking for all-rounders,” he said. “They’re looking to ride to work, or ride on a gravel track, and people who are on a budget looking for the least expensive bike.” Erin O’Melinn, executive director of bicycle advocacy groupHUB Cycling, said while e-bikes represent one of the fastest-growing segments of the transportation market, she knows of no systemic estimate of their share of the overall bike numbers in Metro Vancouver. Between 2011 and 2016, the number of people cycling to work increased from 4.4 per cent to 6.1 per cent, according to 2017 statistics from the City of Vancouver. More people ride to work in Vancouver than any other major city in the country. Overall, the2017 report card on walking and cyclingsaid that “56 per cent of Vancouver residents are interested in cycling more often. “This marks a significant increase citywide in a short period of time. In 2014, only 30 per cent of Vancouver residents were interested in cycling more often.” O’Melinn said research into electric bikes and other micro-mobility devices such as scooters, mopeds and electric skateboards is in its infancy. “HUB’s members have indicated a strong interest in this area and we are ramping up our efforts to understand how such technologies may be effectively encouraged and regulated to increase access to cycling to a broader range of ages, abilities and trip types,” she said by email. Lon LaClaire, director of transportation for the City of Vancouver, believes electric bicycles have huge potential to create more cycling trips. “We’re seeing it already with goods movements,” he said. The worker co-operative Shift Delivery in East Vancouver, he said, uses e-bikes. “For others who don’t have the strength or don’t want to get sweaty, an e-bike is an option that previously wasn’t practical for them. … We’ll be looking at ways to support e-bikes.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com Biking in Metro Vancouver • The City of Vancouver has a bike lane and path network of 322 km, 25 per cent of which are classed as top-AAA, which means for all ages and abilities. The longest segment is the 31.5 km seawall. • Mobi, the City of Vancouver’s bike share, started in 2016 with 250 bikes at 23 stations. It now has 1,250 bikes in 125 stations. The goal is 1,500 bikes at 150 stations. • Bike sharing has spread around Metro Vancouver. Locations include Richmond, Port Moody, and Port Coquitlam, and soon in Burnaby. On the North Shore, the City of North Vancouver is part of an initiative with the District of North Vancouver and West Vancouver to introduce electric bike share by this June. What is an electric bike? In B.C., an electric bike is a two- or three-wheeled vehicle with a seat, functional pedals and an electric motor of up to 500 watts. It can’t be gas powered or travel faster than 32 km/h on level ground without pedalling. Anyone riding an e-bike has to wear a helmet and be 16 years of age or older.

HUBsays safer bike routes will in turn persuade more people to start riding bikes. The big change coming for cyclists in Burnaby is on the Gilmore Overpass above the Trans Canada Highway. Built in 1964, the overpass is one of 400 spots in Metro Vancouver identified by HUB as obstacles that discourage an estimated 40 per cent of people from riding their bike. Burnaby council recently approved spending more than $2 million to add to about $900,000 from TransLink to build a protected bike path on the west side of the overpass by the end of the year. Joe Keithley, a Green Party councillor, said Burnaby has been able to act quickly on the project because a plan for the overpass came before council more than three years ago but was shelved. Keithley said he and Mayor Mike Hurley, both elected last fall, wanted to do something as soon as possible to encourage cycling and sustainable transportation in Burnaby. “We have to get more north-south and east-west bike paths in Burnaby,” he said. “We’re way behind Vancouver.” The permanent changes to the road mean restricting motor vehicles to one north bound lane to create a 3.5-metre-wide path for pedestrians and northbound and southbound bikes. The lane closure would stretch from Myrtle Street to Dominion Street. Keithley said the city lobbied the province to replace the overpass, which has been hit several times by trucks since the Trans Canada Highway was widened, but Victoria said it wasn’t going to spend millions of dollars on a new overpass for another 20 to 25 years. “We thought this would be an expedient and economical way to help people,” Keithley said by phone. “If you want to encourage a generation of cyclists, start them early. If you want to ride with your kid or grandson, you’d feel totally safe with this new plan.” Erin O’Melinn, executive director ofHUB Cycling, said research has shown that unsafe spots, such as the one on Gilmore, are the top reason that people are discouraged from riding a bike. HUB calls them gaps in the map — specific locations where bike routes end abruptly without any safe alternative for cyclists. Citing data from TransLink’s trip diary survey, O’Melinn said many people want to ride their bikes but are held back by unsafe and disconnected bike routes. “There are gaps all over the region where people do not feel safe and there is no reasonable way to get from A to B,” O’Melinn said. “Imagine if there were streets for cars that ended abruptly and you couldn’t get to where you had to go, and had to get out and walk your car.” “It happens all the time when you’re on a bike. When we ungap the map, the region will have safe, direct, paved bikeways that will allow people of all ages and abilities to get where they want to go.” HUB Biking has an interactive mapidentifying gaps in the cycling routes in Metro Vancouver. People can adopt gaps in their neighbourhood by making a $50 contribution to help “ungap the map,” or commuters can tell a story about why the gap matters to them. HUB’s recent successes in eliminating some of the gaps in the map include a one-way protected bike lane along 80 Avenue from 128th Street to 132nd Street in Surrey and a commitment from Langley Township to match TransLink’s $500,000 to expand commuter bike lanes to include Murrayville."
209,"Apr 01, 2019","TheNDPis promising to bring in a universal and comprehensive national pharmacare program targeted to begin in 2020 if the party wins the next federal election. NDP LeaderJagmeet Singhannounced details of the pharmacare plan Monday with health critic Don Davies at an event in Coquitlam. “This is a bold plan, it’s going to take some courage. It’s going to take us standing up to pharmaceutical industries and insurance companies who don’t want us to bring this plan in, but we know this plan will work,” Singh said. The plan would see every Canadian covered for a list of prescription drugs determined by an arm’s-length group of expertsthat it said would be protected from industry and political pressure. The agency would evaluate drugs for coverage based on what is scientifically proven to be safe and effective, and on the best value for money, the party said. It would save families who don’t currently have private drug coverage an average $550 per year and it would save employers about $600 per employee with extended health benefits, the party said. Medications covered under the formulary would always have at least one option involving no upfront cost, in a move intended to nearly eliminate the co-payment system that the party said is a barrier to access. If there is a generic drug available but anindividual chooses a brand name instead, there would be a $5 co-payment with exemptions for vulnerable populations. It’s time to make medication available to all Canadians who need it, Singh said. “We can’t afford not to do this at this point, given how difficult it is for so many people to get the medication they need,” he said. The legislation would be modelled on the Canada Health Act and provide an annual pharmacare transfer to the provinces andterritories, with provinces paying about 60 per cent of the total cost and the federal government providing the remaining 40 per cent. Davies, who represents Vancouver Kingsway, said the cost to provinces will be about the same as they are paying now. It would cost the federal government an additional $10 billion annually on top of what the provinces already pay but Singh saidit’s worth it, pointing to overall cost saving identified in an analysis by the parliamentary budget officer. The report says the total cost of a national pharmacare program would be $23.7 billion in 2020, representing a $4.2 billion savings each year over the current amount being spent on drugs in Canada. Last week, Singh said an NDP government would expand the tax on investment profits as part of a package of measures aimed to pay for pharmacare, affordable child care and housing. “Those measures would free up billions that would be available for this as well. The rest of financing would be a matter ofdiscussion between the federal government and provinces and territories,” Davies said. The federal government taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, or capital gains, but the NDP wants to increase thatthreshold — known as the inclusion rate — to 75 per cent. It said that would raise about $3 billion in revenue. The New Democrats have also talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens, which they say help the rich avoid paying their fair share of taxes to society. Singh took aim at the Liberal government’s pharmacare plan, saying it puts pharmaceutical and insurance companies “in thedriver’s seat.” “The Liberal government is proposing to bring in a U.S.-style patchwork system that’s only going to increase the premiums families pay,” he said. In its budget last month, the Liberal government said Canada’s pastiche of drug coverage, which comprises more than 100 public programs and 100,000 private insurance plans, is not well equipped to handle the increasingly expensive drugs now coming to market. Drug spending in Canada is expected to surpass $50 billion by 2028, an expert panel has found. In the budget, the Liberals promised a new agency to negotiate prescription drug prices for Canadians to try and drive down costs, a move it billed as an “important step” on the path to an eventual national pharmacare plan. It also promised to build a national formulary and promised to spend $500 million a year, starting in 2022, to subsidize drugs that treat rare diseases."
210,"Mar 22, 2019","The B.C. Care Providers Association is calling for the resignation of the province’s seniors’ advocate, alleging her relationship with the Hospital Employees’ Union leadership has been too “cosy.” In a statement, the association also asks the province to conduct an audit and review of the mandate of the Office of the Seniors’ Advocate. But seniors’ advocate Isobel Mackenzie says she never did anything inappropriate, adding that consulting and collaborating with stakeholders is part of her mandate. The association alleges that documents obtained through a freedom of information request show Mackenzie collaborated closely with the Hospital Employees’ Union leadership in shaping a report on the transfer of patients from care homes to hospitals. The report, called “From Residential Care to Hospital: An Emerging Pattern,” was released in August and followed complaints from emergency room clinicians that some care homes were sending residents to the emergency department unnecessarily. The association alleges she shared draft language of the report with the union, incorporated its feedback and notified the union of the planned timing of the report’s release. In contrast, it says the care providers association was never advised in advance by Mackenzie’s office on the release of the report and its members were never notified beforehand of its findings. “We have tried to work with the seniors’ advocate over the years with mixed results,” it says in a statement. “The release of this FOI provides us with a disturbing insight into which organization is having the most profound influence over the OSA.” Mackenzie told The Canadian Press the report was independent from the Hospital Employees’ Union. “What they’ve chosen to say is, ‘Well she colluded with the HEU on this report,’ to which I’m saying, ‘Well how?’ The results, the methodology, the data sources — it’s all there. That has nothing to do with the HEU,” she said. She said sharing contents of reports with some stakeholders or members of an opposition party is common practice. “Everybody does that,” she said. In the past, Mackenzie said she has shared content from reports that are favourable to the B.C. Care Providers Association in advance and not with the Hospital Employees’ Union. In this case, she said her office shared contents of the report in advance with health authorities, the union and contracted care providers, which includes members of the B.C. Care Providers Association. She said her office has a relationship with care providers, but no obligation to the industry association. Mackenzie suggested the association is calling for her resignation because it didn’t like the content of a report that found contracted care providers transfer patients to hospitals more often. “The B.C. Care Providers took great offence to this report. What’s interesting is when the reports serve their interests, they don’t have this problem,” she said. Mackenzie said she is not considering resigning. The association is also calling for a full and independent review of the office. Unlike other advocates that are independent, such as the B.C. Ombudsperson or the children and youth advocate, the seniors’ advocate reports to the Health Ministry, which couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. The association says it also wasn’t consulted on a decision by the B.C. government to move more than 4,000 home support jobs from the private sector to public health authorities, and accused Mackenzie of failing to press the government on that decision. “Not one question was posed by her to government on their reason for the change, or if any analysis had been provided,” it said. “For BCCPA, this was a tipping point.” Mackenzie said she was briefed by the deputy minister and health authorities in advance of the decision and she found there was an argument to be made for the change. Health Minister Adrian Dix said the office’s position under his ministry has never stopped Mackenzie, who was appointed five years ago by the previous Liberal government, from criticizing him or the ministry freely. “She has criticized the NDP government, the Liberal government, the care providers and just about everyone else in her advocacy,” Dix said Thursday. Dix said he has personally been on the receiving end of her criticism but he recognizes that’s her mandate and said she does a “good job.” “If people want to make the argument for a long-term review of what the status of the office should be, that’s something the care providers and everyone else could look at and I think absolutely could be considered,” he said."
211,,"Two late-stage clinical trials for a promising Alzheimer’s drug were axed in a crushing blow for patients and scientific research. This week, pharmaceutical giantBiogenInc. and Japanese company Eisai joined the ranks of frustrated companies that spent years nurturing expensive, experimental therapies that ultimately fell short. Many scientists and drug developers are now asking whether it could be time to find another approach to treat the pernicious memory-wasting disease. The companies will discontinue two phase three trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug, aducanumab, which has cost the partners more than $830 million over the past three years. The results showed that the drug was unlikely to help patients, the companies said in a statement, and the discontinuation wasn’t related to safety concerns. Both companies said they would continue to work together on other Alzheimer’s therapies. Because there were two simultaneous clinical trials, scientists had so much hope for this drug. “This was the closest to the finish line and early results showed not only could we improve cognitive function but also get rid of amyloid in the brain,” Richard Isaacson, a neurologist,told CNN. “This was the most hopeful thing we had.” “This one hurts,” Isaacson said. “Alzheimer’s patients just can’t get a break.” The brain has been a black box for drug developers, but focusing on beta amyloid has long been viewed as the best hope for treating the mysterious ailment that affects millions of Americans and their families. For many, the hypothesis became an article of faith, motivating billions of dollars in research spending and putting thousands of patients through clinical trials. “It’s not science anymore,” said George Perry, a biology professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio and a long-time critic of the amyloid theory. “It has turned into a religion.” Beta amyloid is a protein that collects in the brain and, in people with Alzheimer’s, clumps into plaques. Drugmakers have pursued the idea that by clearing beta amyloid with drugs, they might stop the disease. But it’s still not known if the protein is the cause of Alzheimer’s, or merely a neurological memorial to damage already done. Secret sauce The latest failure, following the unraveling of similar experimental beta amyloid drugs from Merck & Co., Eli Lilly & Co., and Pfizer Inc. in large-scale trials, has scientists questioning whether the persistent focus on targeting the compound has prevented investment in testing drugs against other possible Alzheimer’s targets. Even so, researchers had thought that perhaps theBiogencompound might be different from previous failures. “The hope was that maybe they have the secret sauce. Maybe they have the form of antibody that’s the most potent,” said Samuel Gandy, associate director of the Mount Sinai Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in New York. “I admit to you, we are getting pretty desperate.” Each time an anti-amyloid medication fails, the theory shifts, said Perry. Its proponents argue that a flawed drug didn’t hit the right form of amyloid, or didn’t target patients at early-enough stages of the disease. “I admit to you, we are getting pretty desperate.” The fizzling ofBiogen’s therapy in two large studies is the second such failure this year. In January, Roche Holding AG mostly abandoned another beta-amyloid compound, stopping two large studies after concluding that they would fail. “We are running out of excuses” for why beta-amyloid treatments aren’t working, said Zaven Khachaturian, editor-in-chief of the medical journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia. The field has become so focused on amyloid it has a difficult time shifting gears, he said, but drugmakers “keep trying, hoping that the path they are on is going to give blockbuster drugs.” Part of the science supporting the theory goes back to genetics. Some patients have been found with mutations in genes involved in beta-amyloid production, and are predisposed to get Alzheimer’s. But that doesn’t prove that amyloid is behind more common cases of the disease. “It has never been established that it is causal,” says Murali Doraiswamy, an Alzheimer’s expert at Duke University Health System. He said the field needs to regroup. “We need to re-evaluate all of the ongoing trials, given the latest information.” Billions gone While numerous drugmakers have missed the mark with beta-amyloid treatments,Biogencould be forced to consider a dramatic revamp of its business. News of the trials’ failure carved off nearly a third of the biotechnology company’s market value; its shares ended down 29 per cent on Thursday at $226.88, suffering their worst single-day decline since 2005 and wiping out more than US$18 billion in market capitalization. “It’s clear now, aducanumab is dead,” Mizuho Securities biotech analyst Salim Syed wrote in a note to investors after downgrading the shares to neutral from a buy rating. “The one-liner here is we just don’t see much to be excited about.” On Friday, Eisai shares dropped 17 per cent in trading in Japan, the biggest one-day drop for the stock since 1988. I admit to you, we are getting pretty desperate Drug companies have seen billion of dollars vanish in the quest to develop a drug that could slow the progression of Alzheimer’s. When Eli Lilly revealed that a similar drug failed in late-stage trials in 2016, its CEO disclosed that it had spent US$3 billion working on a cure for Alzheimer’s to that point. Merck and Johnson & Johnson took writedowns after late-stage trial failures. Many drug companies have seen their share prices swing wildly as experimental treatments stumbled in study after study. Overall, there have been about 200 failed attempts to find an Alzheimer’s treatment. Against that backdrop,Biogenand Eisai’s aducanumab had offered a glimmer of hope, and when the studies were halted the bottom fell out. Investors are likely to demand changes to the company’s board in hopes of a spurring a new business-development strategy, said SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “They’re going to have to be a buyer or a seller,” he said. “They can’t sit where they are.” Biogenspokesman David Caouette declined to comment onBiogen’s business-development strategy moving forward. Eisai spokeswoman Libby Holman said the failure doesn’t affect its plans for the other Alzheimer’s drugs it is developing, called BAN2401 and elenbecestat. Late-stage studies will still proceed this year as planned, Holman said. Biogenbonds slumped alongside the shares.Biogen’s 5.2 per cent note due 2045 was among the biggest decliners in the investment-grade market Thursday, falling 3.481 cents, the most ever for the security, according to Trace data. Boxed in Some researchers are still enthusiastic about the amyloid idea despite the growing number of setbacks. The drugs tried so far have failed because they have been hitting the wrong form of the compound, according to Lary Walker, an experimental neuropathologist at Emory University. The drugs have mostly focused on large plaques visible in the autopsied brains of deceased Alzheimer’s patients, he said, but recent data show that the toxic form of amyloid is smaller clusters of proteins that should be targeted instead. “I think it’s the right target,” said Walker, adding that “every risk factor we know” for Alzheimer’s increases or affects amyloid in some way. Still, some scientists say that the pursuit of beta amyloid has limited the horizons of drug researchers. Doraiswamy, the Duke professor, said the companies have too much riding on the approach to surrender. Pharmaceutical giants double down on losing bets because their structure doesn’t allow them to just walk away, he said. “You have a whole division in a company that is betting on a trial, they don’t want to kill it,” Doraiswamy said. Scientists meanwhile are bracing for more trials, and more failures, to come. “There will be more,” said Perry, the Texas biology professor. “It is not the end.”"
212,"Mar 09, 2019","The Fraser Health Authority says it is investigating after Chilliwack Mayor Ken Popoveraised concernsabout a 76-year-old woman who was discharged from Surrey Memorial Hospital and sent by taxi to the Chilliwack Salvation Army shelter, despite mobility and incontinence issues. On Thursday, the mayor requested a meeting with Fraser Health CEO Dr. Victoria Lee to discuss “why vulnerable people are being sent to Chilliwack homeless shelters from another community.” He cited the case of an elderly woman who had no family in Chilliwack, but arrived at the local shelter from the Surrey hospital in early February. Shelter staff were not prepared to care for her medical needs, which included severe incontinence. “Constantly cleaning up fecal matter … is a serious concern for both staff and shelter clients,” said Popove in a letter to Lee. Fraser Health spokesman Dixon Tam said Fraser Health makes “every effort” to find homeless patients a place to go when they are clinically stable and ready to leave the hospital, but “finding suitable housing is a challenge across our region.” Tam said: “We are committed to continue to work closely with B.C. Housing and our municipal partners to develop more options. At the same time, we need to be careful not to use hospital beds as an alternative to stable housing.” Abbotsford homeless advocate Jesse Wegenast said he wasn’t surprised to read the Chilliwack mayor’s account in the newspaper, “but only because it’s such a common practice.” Wegenast’s organization,The 5 and 2 Ministries, opened a winter homeless shelter in Abbotsford on Nov. 1. The next day, he received a call from a Vancouver General Hospital administrator asking if he had space for an 81-year-old patient. Wegenast said he often says no to accepting patients because the shelter is not open 24 hours and people must leave during the day. He’s had requests to take people with severe mobility issues, as well as those who need help with toileting or washing. “The people who work at shelters are often very compassionate, and if the hospital says, ‘Well, we’re not keeping them,’ they feel obligated to help,” said Wegenast. The pastor said he’s rarely seen people in shelters receive home care or followup care, and it’s also difficult for them to get prescriptions filled. Wegenast helped a low-income senior on Friday who recently had half of his foot amputated. The man lives in an apartment and was receiving home care to help with dressing changes, but he’d been unable to get antibiotics for five days since being released from hospital. “When you have people exiting acute care at the hospital and there’s no one to follow that up, it’s bad for that person’s health, and it’s also bad for public health in general,” he said. Unlike Wegenast, Warren Macintyre was surprised to read about the Chilliwack woman’s situation because it confirmed that the experience he’d had with Fraser Health was not uncommon. “I really had no idea this kind of thing was going on,” he said. Three weeks ago, a close family member was admitted to Surrey Memorial after suffering from alcohol withdrawal, said Macintyre. He was placed on life support in the intensive care unit for about 10 days. When he was stable, he planned to enter a treatment program in Abbotsford, but there weren’t any beds available until March 14. “We were told the plan was to keep him in hospital until then, but I got a call Wednesday telling me he’d been discharged,” said Macintyre. Surrey Memorial had sent his relative to the treatment centre, where staff repeated they had no space, so he was returned to the hospital. The man, who had been staying at the Maple Ridge Salvation Army before his hospital admission, took a cab to a friend’s house. His family is hoping he’ll be able to stay sober until he can get into treatment March 14. “I told the hospital, if he goes back on the booze, he’ll be right back here,” said Macintyre. gluymes@postmedia.com twitter.com/glendaluymes CLICK HEREto report a typo.

213,"Mar 08, 2019","Chilliwack Mayor Ken Popove is demanding answers from the Fraser Health Authority after a 76-year-old woman with mobility issues and severe incontinence was discharged from Surrey Memorial Hospital and sent by taxi to the Chilliwack Salvation Army shelter early last month. The woman, who is originally from Surrey, arrived at the women’s shelter with a “walker and some significant health concerns, including incontinence,” said the mayor. Staff were not aware of the woman’s medical issues and found themselves unprepared to care for her. “She should be in a hospital,” Popove said Thursday. “She needs medical attention that the staff at the shelter can’t provide.” The mayor recently visited the woman at the shelter before firing off a letter to Fraser Health CEO Dr. Victoria Lee. The letter was raised during question period in Victoria Thursday by Chilliwack Liberal MLA John Martin, who asked Health Minister Adrian Dix if it was an “acceptable practice” to discharge hospital patients to a homeless shelter almost 80 kilometres away. Dix replied that he couldn’t speak about the specific case but would be happy to meet with Popove about his concerns. He later told reporters he’d be looking into the situation and pointed to the province’s plan to increase long-term care beds. “The key issue here … is the health status of the patient on discharge,” he said. Premier John Horgan told reporters the situation was “startling for me, and I think startling for all British Columbians.” He said the government created the Ministry of Mental Health after finding “cracks in the system.” In his letter to Lee, Popove said he is aware of two cases in which shelter staff were asked to take patients from the Surrey hospital without being told about the care they required. A few weeks after the elderly woman arrived, the shelter received another call from Fraser Health about a man who was being discharged from Surrey Memorial and needed a bed. “After further investigation, they learned that the patient was in a wheelchair, had open wounds on his feet and needed to be in a hospital bed,” said the mayor. “This information was not disclosed by the social worker, and shelter staff realized they would be unable to provide the level of care this individual requires.” Popove asked the Fraser Health CEO to answer several questions, including whether hospitals regularly discharge patients into homeless shelters. “I would like to know why vulnerable people are being sent to Chilliwack homeless shelters from another community,” said Popove. “How is it possible that a 76-year-old woman with multiple significant health concerns could have been discharged from Surrey Memorial Hospital and sent via taxi to a homeless shelter in Chilliwack … away from her home, friends and family?” The woman eventually moved to a temporary shelter at Ruth and Naomi’s Mission where there are no stairs, but her health continued to make it difficult for staff to care for her. She left the shelter on her own and returned to the Salvation Army, said the mayor. Executive director of Ruth and Naomi’s Bill Raddatz said she was at the mission for about a week. “She was very frustrated about her medical condition,” he explained. “She was soiling herself every night, and it was tough because the beds are about two feet apart, so there were complaints. Our staff were not equipped to deal with her medical needs.” Raddatz said the shelter sometimes takes homeless people from the local hospital, but there is adequate communication to ensure the arrangement will work. “No senior should be put on the street,” he said. Fraser Health spokeswoman Tasleem Juma said Fraser Health received Popove’s letter late Wednesday and is looking into his claims. She could not comment on specific cases, but explained that patients are sometimes discharged from hospital into a shelter when they are “deemed to be medically stable.” Like someone who is being discharged to a home, Fraser Health ensures community supports are in place for the person, and shelter staff are informed and must agree to the situation, she said. Juma was unable to say if Fraser Health staff followed this procedure in the two cases mentioned by Popove. — With files from Rob Shaw gluymes@postmedia.com twitter.com/glendaluymes CLICK HEREto report a typo.

214,"Mar 07, 2019","With their sights set on new opportunities to sell products and services into Japan’s rapidly expanding eldercare sector, Canada’s first-ever women-only business mission to Asia will also boost this country’s reputation as a leader in gender equality. “Sending a women-only mission raises the profile of women in Canada and provides an international opportunity to show that Canada doesn’t just talk the talk, it also walks the walk in advancing gender equity,” says Dr. Allison Sekuler, vice-president, Research and Sandra Rotman Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience and managing director of the Rotman Institute at Baycrest Health Sciences, and managing director of (CABHI,) who is participating in the mission as a thought leader delegate. Under the leadership of the Vancouver-based Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada (APF Canada) and with support from the private and public sectors, the 37-member mission, including 22 entrepreneurs whose companies are “export ready,” will be in Japan from April 1 to 3, spending time in Tokyo and Kyoto. The mission will follow two significant events, the Women 20 (W20) Summit and the World Assembly of Women (WAW), both to be hosted by Japan in late March 2019. The initiative is a response to one of the key recommendations from APF Canada’s 2017 country-wide dialogue series, Women2Women in the Asia Pacific, says Christine Nakamura, APF Canada vice-president, Toronto, and the mission’s project director. Both Canada and Japan face the challenge of a longer-living aging population requiring increasingly complex levels of care. The business mission will focus on what Canadian companies have to offer Japan in three specific areas: technologies to support eldercare; services to help the elderly including personal care, health- and long-term care, financial services and other social and entertainment services; and, consumer products that will facilitate or improve the daily lives of the elderly. Nakamura says the women-only mission is intended, in part, to help Canadian women in business expand beyond the domestic market, which often tends to be their primary focus. She points out that Japan, like Canada, sees the advancement of women in business as an economic imperative – and the export market is an important part of the equation. “I’m hoping, at a minimum, for four or five success stories (from the mission) in terms of finding a partner or investment funds for (the delegates),” says Nakamura. Dr. Ito Peng, Canada research chair in Global Social Policy and director, Centre for Global Social Policy at the University of Toronto, is joining the mission as a team expert on the care economy. During meetings with entrepreneurs and policy experts on a recent visit to Japan she was struck by how often “diversity” came up in conversations. “Framed within diversity, the talk is about how to incorporate women and advance gender equality, which is an important policy item for the Japanese government,” she says. In this context, adds Peng, Canada’s first women-only business mission to Asia is very timely. She points out that Japan is demographically the oldest country in the world with almost 29 per cent of the population over the age of 65, a number that’s expected to be close to 40 per cent by 2050. “I see a huge expansion in the health-care market in Japan, which could provide opportunities for Canadian companies with innovative approaches,” says Peng. She notes that Canada is also a leader in multi-culturalism and multi-cultural labour integration. “Japan is beginning to open its borders to foreign workers and immigrants, and they are looking to countries like Canada to learn and understand how to integrate and incorporate foreign care workers into their health-care system, most of whom will be working in eldercare services,” adds Peng. “I’m there to get a better understanding of the eco-system in aging and the brain health space for seniors and to see where we might be able to create partnerships that are mutually beneficial for Japan and Canada,” says Sekuler. CABHI’s role, adds Sekuler, is to accelerate “amazing solutions” coming out of Canada – and Japan is viewed as a premier market for spreading and scaling Canadian innovations that could help improve the lives of the aging population in Japan. For Sekuler, true success for the mission will be more than signing memoranda of understanding; she’s looking for the creation of new, meaningful, lasting, and mutually beneficial partnerships. “I see a lot of potential for us to work with some of the organizations we will be visiting to both enhance the lives of older adults in Japan and help spread and scale amazing Canadian innovations,” she says. Business mission delegate Dr. Elizabeth Douville, founder and managing partner of AmorChem, a Montreal-based early stage venture capital fund in life sciences, already has a business partner in Japan – Senju Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. She’s hoping the mission will not only help raise AmorChem’s profile among Japanese investors, but also highlight the leadership of Canada’s women entrepreneurs. “I’m proud to participate in the mission as a Canadian woman leading a venture fund and to help promote that abroad,” says Douville."
215,"Mar 04, 2019","A medical researcher at the University of Saskatchewan is bringing the quest for a magic bullet in cancer treatment one step closer to reality. Humphrey Fonge is working on a radioactive antibody that latches onto colorectal cancer cells and kills them — while doing little or no damage to neighbouring healthy cells. Current antibody drug therapies slow the spread of the disease but do not destroy existing cancer cells. Fonge said the new “assassin” antibodies, as they’re called, could transform outcomes for many patients, including those at advanced stages. Colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths in North America, is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Those patients generally have a life expectancy of 24 to 30 months. Fonge said he now has “tons of data” to show that the new treatment works. In mice, he has seen a complete cure in “up to 80 per cent” of them. Now an award of more than $800,000 from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research will help him move on to human clinical trials. They won’t begin for another couple of years. First, he has to show the treatment won’t be toxic to patients. Word of Fonge’s work is spreading. Already he has received emails from two patients (one in B.C.) asking to take part in the clinical trial. One of them is at stage four, meaning the cancer has gone to the patient’s liver. Fonge said receiving messages like that “really touches my heart,” and drives him to help improve care. He has also been getting messages of encouragement from back home in his native country, Cameroon. The new treatment is significant because it also offers a fresh alternative to patients for whom other drugs aren’t working, he said. Fonge and his team are also looking at using the assassin antibody to treat pancreatic cancer, and a rare and hard to treat type of breast cancer called “triple negative.” For the latter, he is “seeing really, really amazing outcomes in mice,” he said. Fonge is also working on a better way to diagnose cancer and track the response to treatment using another type of antibody. Whereas current technology enables the success of treatment to be determined after three to six months, the new technology may answer that question within a few weeks, Humphrey said. Health Canada has approved a clinical trial for this work, which he hopes to start in a few weeks. For Fonge, all of this is the fulfilment of a dream. He said he came to the U of S almost six years ago from the University of Toronto, lured by the creation of the cyclotron centre where he now does his research. A radiopharmacist at Royal University Hospital as well as assistant professor at the U of S College of Medicine, Fonge designed the labs where he now works. He also got grants to buy machines for them. It’s quite a transformation. The room where he peers into lab mice to see where the antibodies have travelled used to be a dog kennel. “This kind of research excites me,” he said."
216,"Feb 27, 2019","Jim Mannwants everyone to know that he’s more than his dementia. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s 12 years ago, but that doesn’t mean he can’t be involved in making decisions about his health. The distinction is important for Mann — and many others living with dementia. The Surrey resident is thinking a lot about consent these days after being part of an advisory committee on health care consent for people with dementia. Their report,Conversations About Care, was released Feb. 27. Mann, 70, said professionals in health care still make assumptions about people with dementia. He recalled an emergency room incident when a nurse yelled his name and added “patient only.” “My wife and I stood up and walked over. Halfway there, she (the nurse) yelled again ‘patient only.’ I got up to her and said ‘my wife needs to be with me. I have Alzheimer’s.’She turned around and looked me up and down and said ‘well, you look fine.’ “ Mann said that while the public might not always understand that dementia is a cognitive impairment not a physical one and therefore not visible, he believes that kind of language isn’t acceptable in a health care environment. “Within the medical system, I’m sorry, you should really know this by now,” he said. The two-year collaborative research project that Mann was a part of was undertaken by theCanadian Centre for Elder Lawand theAlzheimer Society of B.C. Funding included a $40,000 grant from the Law Foundation of B.C. The goal of the project’sConversations About Carereport is to ensure that the legal framework in B.C. remains strong enough to protect people living with dementia as well as those named as their legal substitutes. In 2018, about 70,000 people in B.C. were living with dementia. By 2033, that number is estimated to increase to almost 120,000. Krista James, national director of Canadian Centre for Elder Law at the University of B.C., said the report is intended to start a conversation about the rights of people with dementia. “I feel that we’re missing that rights-based lens that recognizes the rights of older people to make choices about what happens to them,” she said. “Although the law is different in each jurisdiction, and this report applies specifically to the experience in B.C., we need to open up that conversation to think about the citizenship rights of older people in a health care context. It’s really urgent.” The report’s 34 recommendations were developed through a process that included consultation with people living with dementia, family caregivers, health care professionals, and others who deal with consent on a regular basis. James said the origins of the report came from phone calls she received from family caregivers who felt frustrated that decisions were being made without consultation. B.C. is ahead of many other provinces because of our comprehensive health care consent statute called theHealth Care (Consent) and Care Facility (Admission) Act. “From our perspective, the health care consent law in B.C. is super robust and I think fairly clear,” James said. “It says if it’s not an emergency, you need to get that prior informed consent. The care facility regulations that govern long term care don’t seem to be consistent. There is a lot more wiggle room.” That means some physicians, licensed practical nurses and care aids don’t understand the concept of prior informed consent for non-emergency care. “I have talked to a few people who think that if the person is in the care facility they have consented to all the care that the people who work there think is the right care for them,” she said. “Some of the staff don’t understand they have to get consent. They confuse admission to the care facility with consent to all the meds.” One of the report’s recommendations calls for all licensed long-term care facilities to set out rules on restraints, including chemical restraints (medications such as antipsychotics used to control aggressive behaviour). Other big concerns include the challenge of sorting out situations where family members making decisions about care for someone with dementia can’t agree on what to do. One way to address that, James said, is to have social workers involved in helping families find a solution. James said the report recognizes that health care providers are never going to be experts on the law. “They’re not lawyers,” she said. “We shouldn’t expect them to be experts on the finer details of the law. They need to have support so they can properly interpret the law.” • Improving health care decision-making laws in B.C. by adding language to recognize that people’s capacity to make health care decisions can vary from day to day and decision to decision, and that they be involved to the greatest degree possible in all case planning and decision-making. • Address barriers to informed consent experienced by Indigenous people and people who need language interpretation, and create financial incentives to support physicians so they can spend time to talk with patients and families. • Create a review tribunal to allow people living with dementia to review health care decisions made by substitute decision makers. kevingrififn@postmedia.com You might also like: CLICK HEREto report a typo.

217,"Feb 16, 2019","Billie Mitchell, the “matriarch” of the Vancouver skating community, died Wednesday at the age of 103. The first female president ofSkate Canada(formerly the Canadian Figure Skating Association) died peacefully in Vancouver surrounded by her family, said son-in-law Jack Zaleski. “She was a wonderful lady,” he said. “She was very driven to get things done.” Mitchell first became involved in the local figure skating community in 1949 when her son and daughter were skating at Kerrisdale Arena. In 1961, she was elected chair of the B.C. section of the CFSA, inadvertently becoming the first woman on the national board of directors. Three years later, she became its first woman president. Mitchell was also the founder of the Arbutus Club, a private fitness club. https://twitter.com/TheArbutusClub/status/1095848890706944001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Eembeddedtimeline%7Ctwterm%5Eprofile%3ATheArbutusClub%7Ctwcon%5Etimelinechrome&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arbutusclub.com%2F “But more than an impressive resumé of a trailblazing woman, my Nana was a good and decent person,” said a Facebook message posted by Mitchell’s grandson Owen Clark. “Her accomplishments were not the result of a deep ambition to wield power or receive praise; her accomplishments were the result of unshakeable confidence in herself, natural unselfishness, and a desire to make life just a little better for someone else. “… She forged her own path when there was no path to follow.” Born and raised in Vancouver, Mitchell was married to John Hardie Mitchell, the owner of Canadian Stevedoring. Together, they established theJohn Hardie Mitchell Family Foundationin 1985. John died in 1987. Mitchell continued to chair the foundation, where “she was always looking for opportunities to help, even if not approached,” said Zaleski. She supported the Pacific Assistance Dogs Society in its early years, the Seafarers Mission, Vancouver Symphony Orchestra and Bard on the Beach. Mitchell had four children, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. Zaleski said his mother-in-law was an avid Canucks fan, who was invited to attend a home game on her 100th birthday by Trevor Linden, her favourite player. “She was thrilled by that,” he said. In anews release, Skate Canada said Mitchell “blazed a path for female leadership in sport” and was devoted to advancing figure skating throughout her life. “Our heart is heavy as such an influential leader in our sport has left us,” said Leanna Caron, president of Skate Canada. “Billie helped to shape the landscape of Canadian figure skating and lead the way for women to follow in her footsteps. She was a true pioneer.” Anentryon the Skate Canada B.C./Yukon website calls Mitchell “the matriarch of our skating family here in B.C.” She was inducted into the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame in 1998, where herbiographysays her “career and volunteer work in figure skating are widely acknowledged as the foundation for skaters, coaches, officials and volunteers of today and for years to come.” gluymes@postmedia.com twitter.com/glendaluymes CLICK HEREto report a typo.

218,"Jan 10, 2019","The number of seniors in B.C. who deferred their property taxes in 2017-18 has grown by 53 per cent in four years, according to a report byseniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie. Last year, 57,305 seniors deferred their property tax, an increase of 13,179, or 21 per cent compared with 2016-17. The total amount of property tax deferred last year was $208.8 million. Mackenzie described the increase in property tax deferral as “dramatic.” She pointed out that 81 per cent of seniors are homeowners. Mackenzie believes the money saved by deferring taxes is being used by seniors to support themselves and maintain their independence in their own homes. “I’m hopeful the reason we’re seeing this is that seniors recognize that they can use it to hire more help around the house,” she said. “It is very cost-effective. It is a very good program.” Numbers showing the increase in property-tax deferral were found inMonitoring Seniors Services 2018, an annual report that gives a snapshot of the state of services and supports for seniors in B.C. In Vancouver, the average amount of taxes deferred in 2017-18 was $6,533 on an assessed value of $2.6 million; the average cumulative amount of deferred taxes was $30,026. In all of B.C., the average amount deferred in the same period was $3,987 on an assessed value of $1.2 million; the average accumulated amount of deferred taxes was $19,752. Theproperty-tax deferment programis open to an eligible homeowner aged 55 and older, as well as their surviving spouses and persons with disabilities. The program started in 1974 and recorded $1.1 billion in deferred taxes to the end of October last year. Deferred taxes are payable once the property is sold. Last year, the amount of tax deferrals repaid to the province decreased by 11 per cent ($72.5 million), the first drop in five years. Mackenzie said the program is meant to pay for itself over time. She thinks it’s such an effective program that it should be expanded to include other senior expenses such as B.C. Hydro. Susan Ogul-Propas is a volunteer with the411 Seniors Centrein Vancouver who has worked helping mostly low-income seniors complete their income tax for the past 14 years. Of the limited number of home-owning seniors she helped at the centre, all deferred their taxes, she said. Her principal residence is in Gibsons. “People have said to me, ‘Why don’t you defer your property taxes?’ I say because I don’t need to do that. I’m financially able to pay my taxes,” she said by phone. But that’s not the case for all seniors. Even retired professionals in Vancouver without a pension often can’t pay taxes as well as all the other expenses associated with a house because of the dramatic increases in property taxes, she said. “I know from a financial point of view it makes sense to defer your property taxes because the interest they charge is so little and it’s not compounded,” she said. Last year, the interest rate on deferred taxes increased from 1.2 to 1.45 per cent. It’s accumulated at a simple rate that is measured on the principal and not at a compound rate that is the principal and added interest. Seniors in their 80s may be reluctant to defer taxes because of memories of growing up during the Great Depression and never owing a penny, she said. For others, it may be because they’re worried about saddling their children with a big bill. “My response is if the house is worth $3 million and they have to pay $100,000 in taxes, it’s no big deal for you to live a better and healthier life,” Ogul-Propas said. Other highlights fromMonitoring Seniors Services 2018include: • Rent subsidies for low-income seniors under the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) program increased by seven per cent to 22,956, but the amount paid grew by 34 per cent to $71 million. • The percentage of seniors admitted to care facilities within 30 days increased to 71 per cent, a jump of 16 per cent compared with the previous year. The highest was 90 per cent in Vancouver, to a low of 45 per cent on Vancouver Island. •First Link, a support program for people with dementia operated by the Alzheimer Society of B.C., saw an increase of 10 per cent to 15,922 active clients. kevingriffin@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

219,"Jan 07, 2019","One of the biggest stigmas around dementia is that you’re going to develop the disease if you grow old, according toseniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie. For January’sAlzheimer Awareness Month, Mackenzie said the biggest stereotype she wants to break down is the belief that the majority of British Columbians85 and olderhave dementia. They don’t. “If you look at age 85 and over, 20 per cent do have a diagnosis ofdementia— but four out of five don’t,” Mackenzie said Monday. When it comes to nursing homes, most people might think that every resident has dementia or Alzheimer’s. In fact, about 35 per cent don’t and two-thirds have only mild cognitive impairment, she said. Mackenzie said dementia is a spectrum. Someone who is diagnosed with dementia may be fully competent in some areas but not in others. In some cases, a person may never go on to develop full dementia. “It’s a journey,” she said. In B.C. in 2018 about 70,000 people were living with dementia. By 2033, that’s expected to increase to almost 120,000. Experts don’t believe the rate of dementia is changing. Instead, the numbers are increasing because there are more older people living longer than ever before. The aim of this year’s Alzheimer Awareness Month is to eliminate the stigma around the disease by changing attitudes. Events culminate on Jan. 31 with a two-hour open house starting at 3 p.m. at theAlzheimer Society of B.C.’s Resource Centre, 301 — 828 West 8th Avenue, Vancouver. One family dealing with the affects of dementia is that of Lisa Glanville and her mother Ollie, 82. Glanville said her mother worked for years as the property manager of Vancouver apartment buildings she owned after her husband died. She also worked as a bartender at the Billy Bishop Legion in Kitsilano. Glanville said she’s seen stigma directed against her mother when she went to an estate planner and explored options for nursing homes. She was told that it didn’t matter because her mother’s dementia meant she wouldn’t remember anything. Glanville said the most challenging times for her was before her mother was officially diagnosed. When she found out that her grandfather died of Alzheimer’s, she wondered if her mother had it. Initially, her mother passed tests measuring her cognitive abilities. But Glanville noticed that things were starting to go awry. One day, she discovered that her mother’s online accounts were locked because someone had unsuccessfully tried to access them. On another occasion, her mother showed her a cup with five of her molars in it. She’d never told her daughter she had any problem with her teeth. “I thought: ‘Whoa, what is going on here?’” Glanville said. The clincher was a visit to the dentist. “The receptionist said to me after my mom went in. ‘Can I give you some advice?’. I said ‘sure.’ ’Have you got enduring power of attorney yet for her Alzheimer’s?’” Since Glanville is an only child, her mother’s well being become her responsibility. As part of her efforts to seek help, she started attending monthly Alzheimer caregivers support group meetings at the Alzheimer Society of B.C. “The validation is incredible,” she said. Morgan Donahue, support and education coordinator at theAlzheimer Society of B.C.’s Vancouver Resource Centre, said she believes that there is a lot of shame associated with a diagnosis of dementia. She said the stigma can even discourage people from getting a diagnosis or even telling people they have been diagnosed. In a survey by the Alzheimer Society in 2018, one in five Canadians said they would feel ashamed or embarrassed if they had dementia; one in five admitted to using derogatory or stigmatizing language about dementia. “I’ve heard so many family members say they wish their family member had cancer because there is so much more of an understanding and acceptance of cancer than this disease,” Donahue said. An early diagnosis can mean the person is displaying few, if any, symptoms at first. “This disease is often so invisible, as with othermental healthchallenges.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

220,"Dec 28, 2018","Drive an hour north of Google’s headquarters up to Oyster Point, south San Francisco, and you will find the office of Calico Labs. The steel-and-glass building has none of the showmanship of its sister company’s colourful campus. Its name is an acronym for “California Life Company” but its lifeless exterior makes it easy to imagine it being named after another Calico – an abandoned mining town further down the Pacific Coast. The company, a division of Google’s parent company Alphabet, is five years old, but its operations remain highly secretive. Calico was the brainchild of Art Levinson, a biotech entrepreneur and former CEO of Silicon Valley pharmaceutical Genentech, which developed several successful cancer treatments. He counted Steve Jobs and the early Silicon Valley pack as friends, and happens to be Apple’s chairman. In the early Noughties, Levinson convinced Google co-founder Larry Page to open a company with a blank chequebook and little pressure to return profit. This company would have one mission: achieve immortality. On Sept.18, 2013, Larry Page wrote to shareholders alerting them that Google had formed a new company focused on “health and well-being [and] the challenge of aging”. Apple’s chief Tim Cook congratulated Art at the time, describing him as “one of the crazy ones”, due to his fearless commitment to suspending old age when others scoffed. Anti-aging has long been regarded as marketing nonsense, a preserve for cosmetic companies keen to convince women to buy moisturizers. The cosmetic anti-aging market was worth $250 billion in 2016 and expected to reach $331 billion by 2021, according to Orbitz Research. How much could a pill that could stop death in its tracks be worth? Scientists are coming around to the notion that age can be treated like a disease, rather than an inevitability, and some have suggested we may be able to find a way to switch it off. The World Health Organisation even added “aging” to its terminology in February this year. Calico was one of the first to jump on a trend that has piqued the interest of venture capitalists looking for a new market. Silicon Valley’s elite, who have grown up being taught that everything can be hacked, see no reason the same can’t be true of our bodies. The symptoms of aging, like white hair and memory loss, are caused by damage to our cells over time as they divide. This constant process starts in the womb but we are able to repair our cells up until about 30. These changes are not consistent among the population. Some 70-year-olds are weak and frail, while others stay fit. That’s what Levinson is interested in. Calico is looking for the magic pill to cure aging, thus eliminating the greater risk of conditions that loom larger with age. Some might scoff at a potion to help us live longer. But scientists have suggested wilder things that turned out to be true. Before Louis Pasteur’s germ theory became popular in the 1880s we believed death by disease was bad luck. The discovery of penicillin in 1928 changed that. So why not imagine a time when we could stop the grip of aging, offering a better quality of life and relieving pressure on healthcare services? Since Calico opened its doors five years ago, we have heard little. Its website lists a few studies and research tie-ups. Last January, it demonstrated that naked mole rats are not more likely to die as they get older. The bucktoothed mammals are notable for their long lifespans and the research appeared to back up Calico’s goal. But no therapies have emerged. A year after Calico was founded, the company announced a partnership with AbbVie, Chicago-based maker of arthritis drug Humira. AbbVie was regarded as a hot stock until Pfizer, Amgen and others announced they would launch similar pills. This summer the partnership was extended, pledging an extra $500 million each to “discover and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases”. Calico will be conducting research until 2022 when it will enter “Phase 2a studies” – or as experts have hinted, human testing – and finally the “late-stage development activities”. The pair have agreed to share costs and profit equally. In November it hired Dr Garret FitzGerald, an Irish professor who has been vocal about our “molecular clocks”, the idea that genes operate on 24-hour cycles and playing with this can slow down damage. Rejigging the molecular clock may delay Alzheimer’s, he claims. He is one of a number of heavyweights at the company whose leaders include Cynthia Kenyon, Dr David Botstein – chairman of genetics at Stanford University – and Robert Cohen, who joined from Genentech after developing groundbreaking cancer drugs, alongside scientists who use computers to detect complex patterns. The company has hit some dead ends. In July 2015 Calico signed up to work with AncestryDNA, which makes DNA-testing kits used by millions. Calico paid for access to pick out families that appeared to live longer, and work out why, but the partnership has ended. Calico made headlines in March when artificial-intelligence expert Daphne Koller quit, the second executive in several months. Outsiders began to ask what was going on at Calico. The company had no response. Notoriously closed to outsiders, even workers in the Bay Area’s blossoming biotech industry have little idea what its team are up to. At the same time, other Google spin-offs such as driverless car company Waymo and balloon-internet project Loon are bearing fruit. Calico’s ambition has always been to make people live forever. Questions about the company’s own lifespan remain unanswered."
221,"Oct 15, 2018","Scientists using digital games to help seniors stay socially connected were happy to see immediate results when they organized a Wii bowling tournament at 14 senior centres across Canada. Not only were the participants connecting with each other for the weekly virtual games broadcast but “massive numbers of people would come out every week to cheer them on,” said SFU gerontology Prof. David Kaufman. “It helps bring people together,” he said. Using technology to help improve the lives of Canada’s aging population is the theme of the AGE-WELL2018 conference in Vancouver on Tuesday through Thursday. AGE-WELL is a national network of centres of excellence researching how technology can increase the physical, cognitive and emotional well-being of seniors. “There are two priorities: Great science and real-world impact,” said SFU gerontology Prof. Andrew Sixsmith, scientific director of AGE-WELL. “We want to create things that will have social benefits.” Some of the products and services being showcased at the three-day conference include self-driving wheelchairs and a Geek Squad-style IT network to help seniors develop computer skills so they can access services and information online. Canada’s aging baby boomers are generally more tech-savvy and have more money than their parents did, which is setting the stage for business opportunities in the “silver economy,” said Sixsmith. “There are lots of opportunities for Canadian businesses to tap into that market,” especially in the areas of health and wellness and financial management and services. But he said there is a “digital divide” among seniors between those with online accessibility and those without, especially those in rural areas or with low incomes. “The federal government should be doing more to ensure equal access,” he said. Kaufman’s research around digital games for seniors shows that compared to the individualistic shooting games popular with younger people, seniors prefer slow-paced action based on board games they are familiar with that is also tied to gaining knowledge. For instance, a digital tic-tac-toe game requires players to answer a question based on a theme such as nutrition or making a will before they can put down an X, he said. He said that helps provide cognitive benefits for the seniors. Digital storytelling has also proved popular. Workshops are held in seniors homes to train seniors how to put together their life stories on video using photos, audio and text, and then invite their families and friends to a showing. “They’re leaving a legacy that’s more than just money or a house,” said Kaufman. slazaruk@postmedia.com"
222,"Oct 02, 2018","When recreational cannabis legalization arrives in two weeks, workers in B.C.’s continuing-care sector should brace for more cases of seniors floored by potent pot brownies sneaked into care homes by their loved ones. That was one of the messages shared by panelists Tuesday atCannabis in Care: ‘Weed’ Like to Know, a pun-packed discussion probing the impact of cannabis on seniors’ care held by the B.C. Care Providers Association in Vancouver. Moderated by former B.C. health minister Terry Lake, the expert panel explored such issues as dosing, treatment, impairment and quality of life that will become front and centre for the sector when the federal Cannabis Act comes into force Oct. 17. Senior cannabis use is expected to climb as legalization reduces stigma and they explore pot as an alternative to alcohol and pharmaceutical drugs. In arecent study on elderly use of medical cannabis, 94 per cent of participants reported an improvement in their condition and a significant number reported a reduction in falls. The treatment also decreased prescription drug use, according to the study, published in the European Journal of Medicine. Panelist David Greb, director of continuing care at the Canopy Growth Corp., said seniors will likely choose to try edible forms of cannabis over smoking and vaping, but said it’s important they start with smaller doses. With orally ingested cannabis, it can take an hour or two for the effects to kick in, and the high can last for four or six hours. Greb said cannabis can enhance the quality of a senior’s social life, serve as a powerful harm-reduction tool by reducing alcohol use, and help with pain management. But care providers will need to speak with families about whether cannabis use is appropriate for their aging loved one, particularly if that person is in cognitive decline, Greb said. He expects many families will bring legal recreational cannabis to an elderly relative’s care home to test whether it may help them feel better. “I’ve seen so many times where families are sneaking in cannabis without the oversight of the clinical pharmacist and the care home,” he said. “I’ve had many cases of brownies coming in because with families, oftentimes, it’s emotional. They’re just looking at anything that’s available that could potentially improve the life of their family member.” Terry Roycroft, founder and president of the Medicinal Cannabis Resource Centre, said care-providers must be watchful of seniors’ dosing. Edibles won’t hit the recreational market until a year after legalization, but in the meantime cannabis-users will be making their own from dried cannabis and oils. Food and beverage companies are gearing up to make tasty cannabis products, including candy and chocolates, and that spells trouble, Roycroft added. Already, Roycroft has seen people bake brownies for their elderly parents from medical cannabis obtained through the federal government. Their parents then experienced a “green out” from taking a dose of THC that is too strong, he said. “Now, no one’s ever died from that, but you feel like you’re going to die and it’s not a very pleasant feeling,” Royfroft said. “Most people, once you have one adverse effect to it, they’re very reluctant to go down that edible path again.” Al Jina, president and CEO of Park Place Seniors Living in Vancouver, said it’s vital that staff and the care home itself are protected, too. Residents also need to be fully aware of the risks their cannabis use presents. Jina said self-administration and dosage will become a major concern when care homes start allowing residents to bring in recreational cannabis. Elderly residents may forget whether they have used it that day, so care-providers must determine how to monitor dosing. One option is storing the cannabis in a double-locked cabinet, so that a staff member would have to bring a key to help the resident access it, Jina said. Jina said other important risk factors to consider include residents sharing their cannabis, its interactions with their other medications, and whether casual and night staff will be knowledgeable of appropriate cannabis use. From a workplace safety perspective, cannabis use may increase risks to residents and staff, and the majority of responsibility for that will fall on the employer, said Stephen Symon, strategic engagement consultant at WorkSafe B.C. Symon said when cannabis is introduced into a care facility, it’s important that employers identify those risks and assess the likelihood of someone being injured due to impairment. WorkSafe B.C. has long hadpolicies in place regarding substance use and impairmentfrom alcohol, prescription medications and drugs, including cannabis, andthose policies haven’t been changed in anticipation of legalization. But with legalization coming, now is the time for care-home operators to update policies and training around impairment, and talk with staff so that they’re prepared to prevent and manage a resident’s adverse reaction to cannabis, Symon said. He said it’s also important for care-providers to remember that while a residential care facility is a person’s home, when staff enter that space it becomes a workplace, and those staff have a right to a safe work environment free from cannabis smoke. neagland@postmedia.com twitter.com/nickeagland CLICK HEREto report a typo.

223,"Sep 11, 2018","In 2013, all the residential care facilities in and around White Rock were visited by a volunteer fromQmunity, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer resource centre. Staff members were asked if they had any queer or transgender residents. The answer? They all said same thing: None of their seniors were LGBTQ. The revealing anecdote was in a Qmunity report calledAging Out. It’s the kind of story that Travis Jones says illustrates how residents end up going back into the closet as they age for safety and security. “We have to become invisible to ensure that we’re fairly treated,” said Jones. “There are people working in care facilities system with more ‘classic’ moral values that fit the age of the community that’s there. It’s like we’re rewinding our lives when we go into these facilities.” Jones is a group facilitator organizing a new weekly event for queer seniors aged 55 and older at theRoundhouse Community Centre.Rainbow Roundtablestarts Sept.14 at 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. and continues every Friday to Dec. 14. “We intend to share stories and wisdom with each about the challenges about aging,” Jones said. The roundtable will be inviting speakers from groups such as Vancouver Costal Health to talk about sexual health, Little Sister’s Book & Art Emporium to demonstrate sex aids, and Quirk-e about writing memoirs. “(The roundtable) is an inclusive group for lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender, queer folks as well as two spirited,” said Jones, a registered therapeutic counsellor. “Maybe we’re not always this perfect rainbow family that we say we are. When it comes right down to it and there’s a need, we bind together and we address that problem. That’s what I’m hoping the Rainbow Roundtable will do.” According toAging Out, there are an estimated 25,000 LGBT seniors living in Metro Vancouver. But that number is likely much higher because it doesn’t include people who are closeted and don’t disclose gender or sexual identities. Aging Out researchers were told that seniors are fearful that health authorities, including residential care and assisted living, are not equipped to meet even their most basic needs. They’re worried that the system isn’t designed to “protect them from harassment, discrimination and abuse based on sexual orientation, gender expression and identity.” “The absence of LGBTQ-inclusive policies, practice and training leaves LGBTQ seniors vulnerable to the homophobia, heterosexism, and/or transphobia of case managers, care providers and other residents,”Aging Outsays. “It also reduces the likelihood of culturally competent assisted living and residential care options for LGBTQ seniors, thereby further increasing the risk of discriminatory practices from other residents or staff. “Due to expected rates of growth and demands on facility admission and placement, it is ideal for the health authorities to begin to strategize and implement changes now.” Roundhouse Community Arts & Recreation Centreis at 181 Roundhouse Mews, the corner of Davie and Pacific. kevingriffin@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

224,"Sep 08, 2018","In the 1990s, Portugal was in the throes of a national crisis, averaging 360 drug overdose deaths a year in a country of 10 million. Today, it has one of Europe’s lowest rates of drug, alcohol and tobacco use and the number of overdose deaths in 2016 was 26. In a weeklong series from Portugal, Vancouver Sun columnist Daphne Bramham looks at the lessons to be learned from the country’s radical approach to addiction treatment. LISBON, Portugal — Almost every day, foreigners knock on João Goulão’s door seeking a solution to their countries’ drug addiction problems. Goulão is Portugal’s director-general of drug policy and the architect of its radical approach, which included decriminalizing all drugs for personal use. Among the pilgrims who have come here are philanthropist Richard Branson, Canadian Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and, recently, an army of politicians and policy-makers from Norway. Fortunately, the former family doctor is infinitely patient, as he’s been answering the same questions for almost 20 years. In the late 1990s, Goulão and 10 others were charged with advising the government how to deal with the 100,000 people — one in every 100 citizens — using heroin. Overdose deaths were averaging 360 a year in the country of 10 million and Lisbon was called the junkie capital of Europe. Goulão was an unusual choice. He had no training in addictions and, rare among Portuguese, no direct connection with addictions. The closest family connection he has to drugs is a niece, who is in her 40s and living in a therapeutic community with schizophrenia caused by drug use. As for his four children, “Hopefully, none of them will have problems.” Because of its interventions, Portugal now has one of Europe’s lowest rates of drug, alcohol and tobacco use across all ages, and the lowest infection rates for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis that are associated with injection drug use. In 2016, the number of overdose deaths dropped to 26 from 40 the previous year. The only thing that most outsiders know about Portugal’s laws is that all drugs for personal use are decriminalized. But what most fail to understand is that all drugs, other than alcohol and tobacco, remain illegal. If police find you with illicit drugs, you’ll be arrested and taken to a police station where the drugs will be weighed. If the amount is above the strictly enforced threshold limits — designed to be a 10-day supply for personal use, or 25 grams of cannabis, five grams of cannabis resin, two grams of cocaine, or one gram each of ecstasy or heroin — you can be charged as a trafficker. If convicted, jail terms range from one year to 14 years. If the amount is below the limit, you’ll be sentthe following dayto the Commission for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction — even if you’re a tourist. There, you will be interviewed by a psychologist or social worker before appearing before a three-person panel that will offer suggestions aimed at stopping your drug use. From there, you’re fast-tracked to whatever services you’re willing to accept. If you refuse help, you can be asked to do community service or even, eventually, facing a fine, perhaps even having possessions confiscated and sold to pay the fine. It’s why Goulão is so quick to point out that Portugal’s success isn’t because of decriminalization. It’s because, in 2001, his country made a commitment to providing whatever its citizens need to be as healthy and as fully engaged in society as possible. “Decriminalization is not a silver bullet,” he said. “If you decriminalize and do nothing else, things will get worse. “The most important part was making treatment available to everybody who needed it for free. This was our first goal.” Underlying the policies is a national conviction that addiction is a chronic, recurring disease best dealt with through treatment not jail. “Our approach is based on respect,” said Goulão. “It’s incremental. Our system works by asking citizens what he can give at that given moment. “If he is completely dependent, I cannot appeal through force of will. I have to help him with his limited capacity to make his own choices. And, step-by-step, the ability of the citizen increases.” Portugal created pathways to health that aren’t punitive. This required investing in treatment and recovery services and establishing a network that connects citizens to whatever they need in a timely manner, whether that’s outpatient counselling, time in a detox centre, even up to three years in a therapeutic recovery community. And it meant that the government made a long-term commitment to ensuring that those services wouldn’t disappear when the economy crashed in 2008. One of Europe’s poorest countries before 2008, Portugal was essentially insolvent after the global meltdown. The US$115-billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union came with strings. The government had to increase taxes and cut spending. Yet, the addictions treatment and recovery services survived almost unscathed. Helped by a boom in tourism, Portugal’s economy is recovering. Even so, its coalition government cut spending by 30 per cent in most areas this year. Again, the exception was addictions treatment and recovery. “We had cuts of 10 per cent because we could explain to politicians that to disinvest would cost more later on,” said Goulão. “We had to sacrifice some things — studies, research and surveys. But the health responses and treatment facilities, we kept them.” It shows how far Portuguese politicians, citizens and even bankers have come in understanding what has been accomplished here. The country’s drug policy has not only saved lives, it’s saving Portugal money. In the first five years, the social costs related to drug abuse dropped 12 per cent, according to a peer-reviewed study in the International Journal of Drug Policy in 2014. Within the first decade, the cost saving had jumped to 18 per cent. Those reductions are in the health costs of drug use and overdose deaths, but also savings to the legal system associated with drug-related criminal prosecutions and reductions in lost income and lost production of individuals serving time in jail for drug offences. Of course, that wasn’t initially obvious to many. In 2001, the United Nations threatened sanctions to punish Portugal for decriminalization and some in the European Union threatened to close the borders. The first indication of change came in 2002. The left-wing party that brought in the changes was defeated, but the right-wing government stuck with it because the first indication of the improvements  were becoming obvious. Today, António Guterres, the prime minister who enacted the policies, is the UN secretary-general and Norway is about to follow the Portuguese model. “Our first goal is to help people to resume their dignity,” Goulão said. “An addict has to do whatever to get his fix each day, I cannot ask him or her to behave as a free citizen.” Often the first task is getting what Goulão described as “the citizenship tools that they need — an identification card and a health card.” If they are acutely addicted to heroin, they’ll be offered enrolment in an opioid substitution program so they can get methadone or buprenorphine to curb their cravings as they move to the next step. Once users are stabilized, Goulão said, “I can ask for more from them, but always with them being assisted with those new focuses.” These days, Lisbon is no Vancouver. There are no cannabis shops, let alone one on almost every corner. The smell of marijuana doesn’t permeate downtown streets, or any streets for that matter. Medical marijuana was only legalized in June. The notion of legalizing recreational marijuana is anathema here. No addicts openly inject heroin, smoke or inhale illicit substances, and there is no drug market where dealers openly sell. No fentanyl has yet been detected in the illicit drugs. So there’s no need for take-home naloxone kits, pop-up treatment tents or specialized training and trauma counselling for first-responders. Until July, there were no supervised injection sites. Three opened in July — two in Lisbon and one in Porto, the country’s second largest city. When you ask citizens what they’d do if they saw someone selling or using drugs in public, most say they’d either tell them to do it somewhere else or they’d call the police in hopes the user could be coaxed into treatment and recovery. There is a national opioid replacement program that providesfreemethadoneto addicts as a means to stabilize them and get them into treatment. A dispensing van circulates through the city on a regular schedule for those whose doctors don’t allow them multiple doses to take home. Despite the easy access to opioid substitution therapy, use is stable with a slight drop in 2016 (the last available statistics) to 16,368 people. It mirrors the generally decreasing trend in opioid addictions. Abstinence — defined as freedom from any form of illicit drug use — is the long-term goal for all addicts, according to Goulão, and Nuno Capaz, vice-president of Lisbon’s commission for the dissuasion of drug use. Both do, however, acknowledge that it may be impossible for all addicts. In B.C. with a population of 4.7 million, there were 27,553 people with methadone or buprenorphine prescriptions in 2016, twice as many as a decade earlier, with the number forecast to rise to 58,000 by 2020. Despite that, provincial guidelines for opioid substitution programs approved last year raised concerns about “low retention rates” — people quitting methadone and buprenorphine — and an under-utilization of opioid replacement therapy as a treatment option, particularly in northern B.C. In 2016, there were only 27 overdose deaths in Portugal, down from 40 the previous year. In B.C., 993 people died of illicit overdoses in 2016. The total rose to 1,422 last year. During two weeks here, I saw no more than half a dozen people who were clearly high. The most obvious were two in Lisbon’s underground Metro. Another was screaming and dancing in the middle of a street in the upscale, Chiado shopping district, while a couple of others were curled up in parks or on church steps sleeping off the effects of drugs or alcohol. Even the small shantytown that I went to with outreach workers didn’t come close to what’s become normal in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside or in the tent cities that have sprung up in this province. Goulão still can’t get over what he saw when he visited Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside last fall. “I was shocked. What I saw took me back to the end of the 1980s and 1990s in Lisbon with the public visibility of drug use and nuisance,” he said. “What shocked me was that there are lots of responses but they do not seem to communicate. They’re not centred on what citizens need. … Citizens should be able to move through the system and get what they need.” It’s got worse since his visit, with the overdose deaths only moderating slightly in the spring as B.C. entered its third year of a public health emergency. He was asked about what would happen in Lisbon if an opioid user had to be revived with naloxone multiple times in a week. “It wouldn’t happen,” Goulão said. “If it did, he’d probably be in a hospital under intensive psychiatric treatment. Four times in a week is not an accident. It has to be intentional. So he would need intensive therapy. … But I don’t know of somebody who would have overdosed so many times.” He acknowledges that Portugal and Europe are lucky to have been spared the wave of fentanyl that is washing over North America. Goulão noted that heroin — opioids in general — have little appeal, especially among Portugal’s youth who have been regaled with tales of the bad days in the 1990s and learned the lessons from their parents and grandparents about its serious consequences. Also, European doctors have  not prescribed painkilling opioids in anywhere near the quantities that have been handed out in North America. “Portugal’s system is not perfect,” said Goulão. “But I believe we have the tools to meet the challenges.” Among its challenges is how to deal with thousands of former heroin addicts who are returning to drug use in their older age. “Twenty years ago, it was possible to find jobs for thousands of people at the final part of their (addictions) treatment,” Goulão said. “There were a lot of small and micro companies and we were convincing them to employ these guys.” The companies would be given tax deductions and government help with the wages. The recovering users would have access to a therapist who was available to assist and motivate. But since 2008, those companies have been closing. The government subsidies disappeared in the mandated cost cutting because they weren’t directly linked to addictions treatment and recovery. “That’s a problem — the sustainability of these kinds of programs. These people lost their new lives. They collapsed like a house of cards and they relapsed. So now, they’re not as confident in our system of care,” said Goulão. “Now, we are opening injecting rooms because they will not accept our invitation to treatment.” dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @daphnebramham Day 1:World comes to study Portugal’s grand experiment.

225,"Aug 17, 2018","Over the past 20 years, the proportion of the provincial budget dedicated to health care has gone from 30 per cent to more than 40 and rising. Currently, it costs B.C. $19.5 billion annually. At some point soon the cost of health care will undermine the provincial government’s ability to provide education, social services, transportation and everything else in its scope of responsibilities. Universal primary care is designed to ensure everyone in British Columbia has a doctor. A doctor who knows them, their health history and in many cases the history of their immediate family. The challenge, however, is setting a timely appointment. On average patients wait three weeks to see their doctor. That wait time is leading more and more people to go to hospital emergency departments. In doing so, they are plugging up the system and driving up costs.

226,"Aug 02, 2018","VICTORIA — B.C.’s seniors advocate has ignited a fiery debate over the types of elder care facilities in B.C., with a new report that says seniors who live in privately run care homes are far more likely to die in hospital than those who live in publicly run care homes. Thereport, released Wednesday, said a senior in a facility run by a private company, a non-profit or a religious organization was 32 per cent more likely to be sent to their local emergency department and 54 per cent more likely to die while there. The seniors advocate, Isobel Mackenzie, called the discrepancy “stunning” and wrote that private operators appear to be persistently failing compared to publicly run facilities when it comes to keeping seniors out of hospital emergency rooms, where their health is threatened by stress, a lack of mobility and hospital-acquired infections. Reducing the hospitalization rates could save B.C.’s health system $16 million a year, free up 15,481 beds and fund half a million additional care hours per year, she estimated. The research intrigued B.C.’s health minister, led to calls of caution from academic experts and sparked an immediate backlash from the group that represents private care providers. “Hospitals are not the best place for the frail elderly,” Mackenzie said in a statement. “We also know that most people want to die at home and for many of our frail and elderly seniors, ‘home’ is the residential care facility. With a rate more than double the public facilities, we really need to ask why contracted care facilities are seeing their residents die in the hospital.” Almost 28,000 seniors in B.C. live in 293 publicly subsidized facilities. Roughly one-third of beds are operated by a public health authority. The rest are run by contractors (including both private companies, non-profits and religious organizations) who receive funding from the government. Private care homes attacked the report, suggesting the research should be peer-reviewed for accuracy and accusing Mackenzie of instilling “fear and uncertainty” with questionable suppositions. Mackenzie said advisers from two B.C. universities helped her staff with analytical models that were independently verified as producing accurate figures. “I caution the media and the public to really look hard at this report and make sure the source data and where it’s come from are accurate,” said Daniel Fontaine, CEO of the B.C. Care Providers Association, which represents most of the province’s private contractors. Fontaine said the report did not substantiate whether the visits to the ER were inappropriate or not. Health Minister Adrian Dix called the seniors advocate’s research a “good report” that has raised some important issues. “The report is interesting, we’re looking at it and it’s a contribution,” he said Wednesday. “I think the numbers shown, that is pretty clear. But to draw too many conclusions, is not. I’m not, for example, saying the fact we’re understaffing private care homes is the cause of this. But it is a quality-of-care issue — that is beyond any doubt.” Why private facilities have such higher hospitalization rates was not answered in Mackenzie’s research. Mackenzie questioned whether factors could include the skill mix of private staff, a lack of stable clinical leadership, the generally lower pay rates, and the private sector’s practice of firing its employees and rehiring them at lower wages (a practice known as contract-flipping). “Undoubtedly, some contracted care providers will be uncomfortable with some of these questions and fixing the problem may have a financial impact on the care home operators’ profitability,” wrote Mackenzie. “However, fixing the problem may also bring the care home operators more resources that will allow them to improve the outcome of care for their residents, and that is a goal that we should all embrace.” The report’s inability to identify the cause of the higher hospitalization rates provided ammunition for critics. “Rather than just issue yet another report with more questions and no answers and no conclusions and recommendations, I’d highly encourage the minister to recommend to the seniors advocate that she take a few moments to actually talk to the sector,” said Fontaine. “It’s not helpful to have these types of reports with inflammatory headlines go out to the public.” Jennifer Baumbusch, a University of B.C. seniors expert, said hospitalization rates could differ because public facilities have historically had better access to specialized resources and staff, and that not all private care homes can handle residents with complex health problems or help them plan for end-of-life care. “It’s very difficult when you are working in a care facility and a resident and family are saying it’s time to go to the emergency room,” said Baumbusch, an associate professor in the school of nursing. “As a staff person, unless there’s been a lot of pre-planning, you can’t go against the wishes of the people. So that number 52 per cent says to me we also need to do a better job of preparing people and doing advanced planning across all types of sites.” Baumbusch also urged caution with the lack of conclusions. “I think it needs to be a bit more of a thoughtful analysis to dig down and say why is this happening,” she said. The private sector’s role in providing seniors care beds grew significantly over the past 16 years under the previous Liberal government. Whether the new NDP government will reverse that trend remains unclear. Dix said Wednesday that his plans for $240-million in additional funding over three years to improve direct care hours will go to a mixture of private, non-profit and public facilities. Mackenzie wrote she was compelled to conduct her research after working alongside front-line staff in six B.C. hospitals and hearing from doctors and nurses that it was predictable to see some patients admitted because they came from care homes with high hospital referral rates. “The data do support the first observation from emergency department clinicians that private care facilities are sending residents to the emergency department more frequently than public facilities, even though the data indicate they care for less complex and frail residents,” Mackenzie wrote in the report. “The data also support the observation from some clinicians that, all things being equal, the contracted care facilities are not accepting the residents back to the facility as quickly as the public facilities, resulting in longer lengths of stay, higher conversion to alternative level of care (ALC) and higher rates of death in hospital.” The most common ailments that result in a senior’s death in hospital are pneumonitis, pneumonia, sepsis, hip fractures, congestive heart failure and progressive lung diseases. The B.C. Care Providers Association put out figures Wednesday that it said added context to Mackenzie’s report, arguing the number of potentially inappropriate hospital transfers from private facilities was actually much smaller than cited in the report, and could be as few as an average of five questionable transfers each year per facility. Mackenzie disputed that, saying some of the seniors who were appropriately accepted by hospitals as in-patients may still have been able to have their medical problem treated at their residential facility. Dix said disagreements around the report and the issue of public versus private seniors care needs to be muted so that everyone can work together to improve the system. “I think the problems are big enough that people need to chill.” rshaw@postmedia.com twitter.com/robshaw_vansun"
227,"Jun 30, 2018","The Vancouver Sun’s series on seniors’ care in B.C. brings to light challenges in how we care for people who bear the greatest burden of chronic disease. The provincial government has offered solutions such as hiring more care aids, opening additional long-term care beds and increasing support for seniors living at home. Readers should also be aware that B.C.’s medical doctors are working with the provincial government on the Residential Care Initiative. Through non-profit organizations called Divisions of Family Practice (also funded by Doctors of B.C. and the provincial government), family doctors are creating local, grassroots residential-care solutions that reduce unnecessary hospital transfers, improve care experiences for patients and providers and reduce costs to the system while improving quality of care. All divisions have RCI projects, meaning that 99 per cent of the eligible 30,000 residential-care beds in the province now benefit from RCI work in some way. RCI projects around the province provide residential-care patients with access to comprehensive care from their family doctor through regular visits, after-hours on-call coverage and care team meetings. Strong doctor/patient relationships play an important role in improving patients’ overall health and quality of life, especially when a patient has complex needs such as dementia, diabetes and heart and lung disease. Providing patients with regular physician visits in local facilities has reduced unnecessary hospital transfers significantly in many regions. For example, transfer rates have been reduced in Mission by 33 per cent, in Kootenay Boundary by 34 per cent and 31 per cent in Salmon Arm. Meaningful medication reviews are another component of RCI projects. Care teams — which can include doctors, pharmacists, nurses, care aids, family members and the patients themselves — review the goals of care and the current plan in order to avoid negative medication interaction, eliminate unnecessary prescriptions and investigations and reduce the number of patients prescribed antipsychotic medications (an issue outlined in the Vancouver Sun series’ fourth instalment, entitled, The problems with residential care.) Physician-organized medication reviews in the Kootenay Boundary region have reduced the number of patients on antipsychotics without a diagnosis of psychosis by 28 per cent and reduced the number of patients on nine or more medications by 15 per cent. Medication reviews in Mission have also helped reduce the number of patients on nine or more medications by 18 per cent. Reviews in Abbotsford facilities have reduced the number of patients on multiple medications by 6.7 per cent and the number of patients being prescribed antipsychotics by 8.7 per cent. These early data represent a small fraction of the results, as meaningful medication reviews are underway in facilities in Vancouver, Victoria, the Fraser Northwest and Shuswap-North Okanagan regions and in other communities around B.C. To ensure value, RCI projects undergo in-depth evaluation and the early results are encouraging. While the RCI will not fix all of the systemic challenges facing our aging population, we commit to continuing to improve our patients’ quality of life through this work. Further evaluation of local RCI projects will identify which initiatives can be scaled to residential-care patients in communities around the province. It also shows that when we all work together — doctors, government, health authorities, health providers and patients — we can truly make a difference in the health of our patients and communities. Dr. Eric Cadesky is president of Doctors of B.C."
228,"Jun 22, 2018","By all accounts, Dorothy Housden has an ideal situation for someone living with dementia. She’s in a bright and spacious ground floor suite in a house with her son Bill and his wife Mila Coutinho living above. Dorothy’s bedroom has a high enough ceiling to hold a sleek lift above her hospital bed, which is covered with one of her gorgeous black and patterned hand made quilts. Although the doorways are a tight squeeze, Bill or Mila can push Dorothy’s wheelchair out to the ground-floor deck in the backyard. If it’s sunny and warm, Dorothy, 86, can sit beneath the grape vines watching for chickadees. Dorothy’s new digs are a recent change. She used to be upstairs but when her ability to walk deteriorated, the stairs became a barrier. “I almost went over backwards twice with her, taking her up and down the stairs,” Bill said. “It was obviously too dangerous.” Bill figured that as Dorothy’s dementia progressed and her mental capacities declined, learning how to operate a stairlift would be too difficult for her. Once a champion quilt maker, Dorothy can still knit, but stopped making her colourful quilts about 18 months ago. Making the suite comfortable for Dorothy wasn’t cheap. Altogether, it cost about $35,000 to buy the lift, hospital bed and wheelchair and make other changes. Bill considers it money well spent. “I always promised Mom that she could die at home in her own bed,” he said. “I’d do anything for my mom. There’s nothing I won’t do for her. She’s the only mom I’ve got.” As for Dorothy, she loves where she lives. “I love being with my family more than anything,” she said. Bill and Mila are part of a huge but relatively unacknowledged part of the health care system in B.C. They’re two of an estimated one million people whocare at homefor family, friends and neighbours living with dementia and other diseases. In B.C. alone, it is estimated that replacing what they do with paid caregivers would cost up to $3.5 billion a year. Not all the home caregiving is as extensive as what Bill and Mila provide. Home care can range from relatively simple tasks such as buying groceries for a friend or driving Mom or Dad to a doctor’s appointment to much more time-consuming and intimate help such as bathing or full-time, live-in care. But while volunteer home care saves the public dollars and cents and keeps people at home and out of the province’s 293 residential care facilities, there’s still a cost to home caregiving, said Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s seniors advocate. The psychological burden of caring for someone with dementia at home can be immense, she said. Caregivers in Distress: A Growing Problemby theSeniors Advocateshowed that the number of caregivers experiencing stress has grown in the past few years by two percentage points to 31 per cent. Caring for a loved one with dementia increases the risk of caregiver distress by 25 per cent. If you add behaviour problems and psychological challenges to the dementia mix, the risk of caregiver distress rises to 75 per cent, according to thereport. “We don’t like to talk about it but the repetitiveness of living with someone with dementia can be extremely exhausting,” Mackenzie said. “It’s the psychological burden. Different people handle it differently. Some people are very philosophical about it, some people are very traumatized and some are very angry about it — they’re angry at their loved one for becoming like that. It’s a whole cornucopia of responses.” Lycia Rodrigues is fromFamily Caregivers of British Columbia, the province’s go-to association for people caring for loved ones at home. Rodrigues said many caregivers feel isolated. “Many caregivers call us because they’re providing care alone,” said Rodrigues, caregiver support and engagement lead. “They don’t have a lot of information in terms of benefits they can have as caregivers or community support close to where they live.” In many cases, she said, caregivers don’t chose their new role. They fall into it simply because it’s expected that’s what a wife, daughter or other family member will do. But because most family members don’t have the training to nurse someone at home, they aren’t prepared to care for someone with dementia. Of caregivers who used the services in 2017-18 ofFamily Caregivers, 84 per cent were women. “One of the challenges we have here is to help caregivers to identify themselves as caregivers,” Rodrigues said. “They say, ‘Oh I’m a daughter, I’m doing what a daughter is supposed to do.’ They don’t see themselves as caregivers. They can take a long time to ask for support.” That can mean the stress continues to build until it takes a toll on the caregiver’s health. “I have caregivers who say: ‘I’m fine, I’m fine.’ But they’re not. At the end they’re the ones who get sick and burn out. We have cases of people having heart attacks and strokes. These are the ones who develop chronic illness after providing care for a long time.” The main way for home caregivers to get help is by calling the toll-freeCaregiver Support Line at 1-877-520-3267. Trained staff can help caregivers with everything from navigating the health care system and finding a support group in their area to connecting with one-on-one caregiver coaching and being notified of the next caregiving webinar. A wife, for example, may be in a situation where the care she’s providing for her husband is becoming too much to handle. She could be facing a major life decision about whether to transfer a loved one to residential care. She may be feeling guilt or anger or both. “Sometimes they say, ‘This is the first time I have someone to talk to about what is happening because nobody understands.’” Rodrigues said. “When I answer calls, I provide a lot of emotional support.” Additional respite help is on the way for home caregivers. On Monday, the provincial government announced it was going to spend $75 million during the next three years on areas such as providing more respite beds and on expanding adult day programs to include evenings and weekends. Between 2016 and 2017, theCaregiver Support Linesaw a 36 per cent increase in calls from unpaid caregivers. During that time, caregiver situations have grown more complex. Callers now are more likely to be in situations where they’re caring for someone with dementia and diabetes, for example, or Alzheimer’s and depression and Parkinson’s.Caregivers are reporting the added stress of not having enough money to care for the person they love. “The stress of caregivers who burn out is related to the complexity of the care recipient,” Rodrigues said. Dorothy Housden fits the profile of someone living with dementia and other health issues. Dorothy, who worked as a registered nurse in the maternity ward of Surrey Memorial Hospital until retiring, has dementia but doctors aren’t sure what type. She may have a bit of Parkinson’s as well as a heart condition known as atrial fibrillation. During a visit by Postmedia, she was alert, smiling and able to respond to some questions. But her son Bill said that as the day progresses, her behaviour can change dramatically. By later in the afternoon she can start shaking so violently, she looks like she’s having a seizure. As a way to help, Mila came up with the idea of showing Dorothy videos of babies on YouTube. It calmed her right down. At a meal, her food has to be cut into small pieces but she eats so quickly, there’s a danger she may choke. She can become very possessive of her pills and say things like: ‘I’m afraid I’m going to be alone at the table all night.’” Bill, 57, and Mila, 51, reassure her that she’s not going to be alone but, as Bill says, “It’s tough to watch.” Bill, a former mechanic, is able to care for his mother because he’s disabled himself and retired from work because of a degenerative disc in his back. He and Mila have been sharing caregiving but that’s about to change. Mila has found a full-time job. Soon, he’ll be taking care of his mom by himself. “I may have to ask for some help,” he said. Bill doesn’t know exactly where to turn. He has a caseworker with Fraser Health, but so far he hasn’t used subsidized home care because he’s not convinced the amount of help they would receive is worth the $37 an hour they would have to pay. He said it doesn’t make sense for him to pay a homecare worker to do tasks such as changing the bed when he can do that himself. But he would welcome help with perineal care. When someone is living with dementia and develops incontinence, the perineal area has to washed daily to prevent infection. He thinks hiring and paying for a nurse privately may be a better way to spend their money. As a break from caregiving, the couple have usedrespite caretwice — most recently for five days at Fort Langley Seniors when Bill was away in Atlanta. They paid the publicly subsidized rate of $37.10 a day; otherwise it would have cost $200 a day. (They can use a maximum 30 respite days a year.) “They took good care of her. She loved it.” But Bill sees a problem ahead with Dorothy’s adult day program run bySeniors Come Share Societyin Guildford. Every Tuesday, Dorothy is picked up by 9 a.m. and returned by mid-afternoon. While Bill and Mila get a break, Dorothy meets other seniors, does chair exercises, and has lunch. Bill and Mila pay $9.25 a day for the subsidized program, which would otherwise cost $90 a day. They pay the subsidized rate of $5.70 for a return HandyDart trip (the actual cost is$85.46). The big service the day program provides is showering Dorothy. Neither Bill nor Mila can wash her properly in their cramped basement bathroom. You can hear the stress in Bill’s voice when he says: “It’s getting to the point where they can’t handle her. I don’t know how long we’re going to be able to do that.” Dorothy enjoys the day program so much, Bill would like her to go twice a week. But because there’s such a demand for spaces, one day a week is all that’s available for her. “I think there needs to be more funding for it,” he said. “The interaction is good for her. Sitting and knitting and sitting in front of the TV all day is pretty tough I think.” 31: percentage of home caregivers experiencing distress which includes feeling angry or depressed 36: percentage increase in the number of calls to the Caregiver Support line during past year from 425 to 577 44: number of home caregiver support groups across the province 91: percentage of home caregivers who are family members, with adult children, a spouse, and other family members ranking 1,2,3 216: percentage increase in the number of one-on-one family caregiving coaching sessions between 2016 and 2017 1,000,000: estimated number of people in B.C. providing unpaid home care to people with dementia and other illnesses 3,500,000,000: estimated value in dollars in B.C. of unpaid care provided by volunteer home caregivers. -Sources:Seniors AdvocateandFamily Caregivers of B.C.

229,,"Erna Dreger held out as long as she could. She kept her husband Paul out of the seniors care system for nine years, caring for him at home after he was diagnosed in 2003 with early onset Alzheimer’s disease. But Paul, now 80, liked to go for walks by himself. Erna realized his wandering had become dangerous when he got lost and she had to call in police to find him. “I knew I had to be smart before something tragic happened,” said Erna, 77. As she began her agonizing search to find a home for Paul, Erna heard about theCzorny Alzheimer Centrein Surrey. She didn’t know that it was considered among the best publicly funded residential care homes for people living with dementia in the province. She liked Czorny’s intimate design, which groups 12 residents together in a cottage-like setting. Each has a private room with en suite bathroom and shower. There are no long hallways like those in institutions such as hospitals. Instead, the living areas are designed so that residents can keep walking without feeling trapped by coming up against a locked door. Residents can also go outside and walk a path in the garden that is bounded by a high fence. Maybe the biggest plus for Erna is that the staff atCzornylet her play a big role in Paul’s care. She visits him twice a day, usually late in the morning to help him shave, and again at dinner to help feed him. At 6 p.m., they watch the TV news together. This month, the couple will have been married 58 years. “I’m happy that I can help Paul, so the staff can be with other residents who don’t have anyone,” she said. “I’m hoping that more facilities like this will be built. Paul and I are very grateful.” Paul is one of 72 residents at Czorny, one of the province’s 293 residential care facilities — often simply called nursing homes. Altogether, they care for about 27,000 people. Czorny is unique in several ways, including its groundbreaking approach to design and the flexible way it cares for people with dementia. But it’s also part of the story about the growing number of people with dementia. In B.C. in 2018, about 70,000 people live with dementia. By 2033, that number is estimated to increase to almost 120,000. Nationally, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase to 937,000 from 564,000 in the same period. Part of the reason for the increase in the number of people with dementia is that people are living longer than ever before, saidDan Levitt, an adjunct professor of gerontology at Simon Fraser University. Advanced medical technology, better disease prevention and better nutrition means that many traditional diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and stroke, have become manageable and chronic. Many people now live into their 80s, 90s and even past 100. “The fastest growing segment is people over 100,” he said. And because of that bigger pool of elderly people, more people live longer and go on to develop dementia, including Alzheimer’s. “We’ve never seen this many old people and this number of people with dementia. It is a societal issue.” Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s seniors advocate, said while it appears that a wave of dementia is about to sweep over the country, she advises a more nuanced approach. The No. 1 issue with aging and dementia, she said, is to recognize that most seniors do not have, and will not get, dementia. “It’s so we’re not creating an expectation and fear and we aren’t treating people who don’t have dementia in an undignified way simply because they look like people who do,” Mackenzie said. She said people should realize that dementia isn’t a single disease but describes a number of degenerative brain diseases. While people with dementia often share certain characteristics, its progression in each person is unique. The most common form is Alzheimer’s, which makes up 64 per cent of people with dementia. As the total number of people with dementia grows, their demographic profile is also changing. Because seniors are living in their homes longer, they’re going into nursing homes when they’re older and have started to show signs of dementia or other physical challenges. The average age today of entry is now 85. Many of the province’s nursing homes are in older buildings designed to resemble hospitals, with long hallways and nursing stations. They’ve been built on an institutional model and tend to have inflexible systems of caregiving that require residents to fit into a pre-determined schedule. It’s a model, for example, that forces everyone up at 8 a.m. to finish eating breakfast by 9 a.m. rather than allowing them to decide for themselves when to wake up and when to eat their first meal of the day. Mackenzie said what’s needed is an attitudinal change to combat the limitations of the physical environment in nursing homes. Number 1, she said, is to persuade care staff that what they’re doing is providing services to people in their home. She said being in a residential care facility should be more like staying in a hotel where a service is being provided to a customer. “Unfortunately, in our public health care system — which has tremendous benefits — there is an unintended consequence: the arrogance of a monopoly service provided by government,” she said. “That mentality, to some extent, is in our residential care system.” Czornyis one example of a patient-centred approach. From the inside, Czorny looks more like a suburban home than an institution. Medications, for example, aren’t left on trolleys in hallways. They’re in their own room and only brought out when needed. The Czorny is so not institutional that Paul Dreger kept trying to tip after meals when he first moved in. He thought he was living in a hotel. Paul lives in one of six cottages. Designed in an A-shaped pattern, each cottage has a living room area with sofas, a central kitchen and different areas for eating. Erna isn’t sure why Paul was able to get into Czorny in 2013. She was told by a case worker that he might be on the waiting list for a couple of years. Instead, there was an opening within three weeks. She thinks that Paul may have been chosen in part because he was still physically healthy and mobile, and younger than most people with dementia who need to be in a home. Paul’s first name is by the front door of his suite along with photos of him with Erna. One photo shows Paul as a much younger man taking a swing with a driver on a golf course. Every night, during her second visit, Erna lays out Paul’s clothes for the next day. “It means everything to me to be involved in his life,” Erna said. As a publicly-funded facility,Czorny is uniquenot only in its design but in how it was built. It exists because of a donation of its 3.39 hectare (8.4 acre) site and $10 million by the family of Marilyn Stewart. Her father, Michael Czorny, lived with Alzheimer’s in the 1960s when there was little awareness of the disease. During one six-month stretch, he was heavily sedated and restrained in a straitjacket. He died in 1985. After that painful experience, Marilyn dreamed of building a facility that was “comfortable and homelike” and designed for people with dementia. Louise Brown is the clinical manager atCzorny. She’s worked at the centre since it opened in 2007. She said that unlike many residential care facilities, residents are allowed to wake in the morning at whatever time they want. If they miss breakfast at 8:30 a.m., that’s not a problem. There’s always food available for a late riser. Brown said the goal at Czorny is to make the centre as much like home as possible. The day isn’t traditionally organized with specific activities at set times such as bingo at 10 a.m. followed by chair exercises an hour later. In part, that’s because staff has found that kind of structure doesn’t work for people with dementia. “We change the system to fit the resident,” Brown said. “We don’t try to adapt the resident to the system.” Other examples of the new kinds of approaches to caring for people with dementia includeThe Village, aprivately funded dementia villagefor 78 residents in Langley scheduled to open in 2019. Another is Providence Health’s project at Heather and West 33rd in Vancouver.Providenceplans to build the first publicly funded dementia village with multiple levels of care for about 300 people on the old St. Vincent’s Hospital site. Dan Levitt, in addition to teaching about aging at SFU, is executive director ofTabor Villagein Abbotsford. Tabor has 261 beds, suites and rental apartments that provide a continuum of care from independent living to complex care. Earlier this year, Tabor Village was awarded anexemplary standing,which is the highest honour given byAccreditation Canada, the country’s independent surveyor of institutions caring for seniors. Tabor Society is a not-for-profit Christian society funded by Fraser Health with some private pay beds. Levitt believes the untold story about traditional nursing homes is their emotional disconnectedness. “They’re devoid of touch, the kind of human interaction that most of us have in our lives. It sustains us,” he said. The damage of not being touched might not be visible like a bruise from a physical injury but it’s still there. “There is something going on in the warehousing aspect that is damaging to the soul of a person,” he said. “I think it has an equal impact on the individuals who are caring for them and their families. It has a damaging affect on everyone.” The current system, Levitt said, gives older adults or their families little involvement in choosing what will likely be their last home before they die. The lack of choice is so restricting that in some cases, he said, a health authority will assign a person not only a particular room but the same weekly bath time as the person who  previously occupied the room and had died. Getting into a centre such as Czorny isn’t easy. To be eligible for Czorny, for instance, a senior must live in the Fraser Health region because admission to subsidized residential care is managed by the local health authority in each of B.C.’s five regions. After an evaluation by a case worker, a senior is assigned to the first available and appropriate bed. Sometimes, the family of the person living with dementia isn’t ready for the big move or decides the institution isn’t a good fit. If the bed offered by the health authority is turned down, the senior goes stays on the waiting list for the next available bed. Next year, Tabor plans to start raising $11 million for a new $36-million centre in Abbotsford designed along the lines ofThe Green House Project. Part of a movement started in the U.S. by Dr. Bill Thomas in 2001, Green Houses are designed to create a more humane alternative to traditional nursing homes. Tabor plans to build a six-storey home with 14 people in 11 households — 154 in total. In each household, residents will be given autonomy and independence to make decisions about how they live together as a group. The new Tabor centre will have 140 funded beds and 14 private-pay beds. “They can decide how they spend their day — regardless of where they are in the dementia journey,” Levitt said. “They will decide when they have breakfast and what activities they want to do.” Families will be encouraged to be involved in caregiving and staff will be multi-skilled and trained to maintain a home for residents. The care home won’t have long hallways or impersonal cafeterias. “If (staff isn’t) task-focused to do certain tasks by a certain time, they could spend time emotionally connecting with the residents, which, I believe, combats loneliness, helplessness and boredom,” he said. “I believe the workers will have a better quality of work life because they will be more emotional and relationship focused.” Even a nursing home in an older building designed according to a hospital model can provide residents with a fulfilling life — as long as a patient-centred approach starts with leadership. “At the end of the day, the residents live in a house that we happen to work in. They don’t live in our workplace. If we have that perspective, then how can we serve them best?” Levitt said. “How can we design our jobs around them?” kevingriffin@postmedia.com 30:Percentage of people with severe cognitive impairment in residential care. 60:Percentage who have dementia and live in their own home. 85:Average age of resident in a long-term care facility. 293:Number of residential care facilities divided between 110 publicly owned and operated facilities and 183 non-profit and private contracted facilities operating with public funds. 871:Average number of days people live in residential care. 1,461:Number of privately paid for residential care beds outside of the public system. 5,000:Number of people under the age of 65 who have been diagnosed with dementia. 70,000:number of people in B.C. living with dementia. 120,000:Estimated number of people living with dementia by 2033. 564,000:Number across the country living with dementia. 937,000:Estimated number of Canadians living with dementia by 2033, a 66 per cent increase. 33,000,000,000:Cost in dollars in 2018 to care for people with dementia. 294,000,000,000:Estimated cost in dollars of caring for people with dementia by 2040. Dementia is an umbrella term to describe the symptoms of a number of illnesses that share characteristics such as loss of memory, impaired judgment and reasoning, and changes in behaviour and mood. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia. It’s a progressive and incurable disease of the brain that affects language, everyday physical activities and the ability to recognize or identify objects.

230,"Jun 21, 2018","Chef Nader Tabesh stands inside a massive walk-in refrigerator, surrounded by 30 dozen eggs, a stack of salmon fillets, and boxes of fresh fruit and vegetables, as he gets ready to make dinner for 100 seniors at Burnaby’s Normanna care home. “For most people at care centres, the biggest challenge can be the food. So we make sure visually it has to be good, nutrition-wise it has to be proper, and the food has to be edible so residents enjoy the meal,” says Tabesh, whose company Angel Food Services provides three meals and two snacks a day for five seniors’ homes in Metro Vancouver. “When they are in the care centre, activities and food are the biggest part of their day.” But the meals at B.C.’s 300 care homes are likely to range from no-frills fare to home-cooked favourites, as revealed in a recent investigation by the B.C. seniors advocate, Isobel Mackenzie, which foundlarge differences in how much money was spent on food. A home in White Rock had the cheapest food budget, spending just $4.92 a day to provide three meals and two snacks per resident. The average cost across the province was $8 a day — far less than the $10.21 spent on feeding inmates in provincial jails, Mackenzie said. If you are investigating care homes for yourself or a loved one, experts suggest you ask many questions about the meals: Are all four food groups included? Are they low in sodium and saturated fat? Are they cooked from scratch and not processed? Are the ingredients fresh and not from a can? ”One of the things people should consider when they are looking at homes is to look at menus,” said Rachel Murphy, an assistant professor in UBC’s faculty of medicine, who has an expertise in both aging and nutrition. “All age groups are not really getting the nutrition we require, but I think it can particularly be challenging for seniors.” The ideal meal, Murphy said, includes fresh fruits and vegetables on half the plate, along with a high-quality, lean protein (such as chicken, fish or eggs). Because seniors tend to eat smaller portions, having two healthy snacks a day is also important so they get sufficient nourishment. “Often times in seniors homes they rely a lot on tea and toast, which is a comforting food but it doesn’t provide a lot of nutrients,” she said. Older people also need more vitamins and minerals, such as B12 and calcium, which they ideally should get from food rather than supplements, Murphy said. Postmedia analyzed the data collected by the advocate’s office for the 300 homes, and found there were about 50 that only spent between $4.92 and $7 daily to feed one person three meals and two snacks. Three out of every four of these low-spenders were run by private companies, with the others operated by the local health authority. All seniors’ homes — whether privately or publicly run — receive their funding from health authorities, which have traditionally provided lower funding contracts to private operators. The disparity in contracts is something the health minister says will be addressed with new money that was earmarked for seniors’ care in February’s provincial budget. Ten care homes spent far more than the others, between $12 and $18 a day, but they were all in the North or in isolated areas, and in most cases had a small number of residents. Mackenzie referred to the highest-spending home, a small facility on Haida Gwaii, as “an outlier.” The next 30 homes with the highest food tallies budgeted between $9 and $11, among them Langley Gardens and Surrey’s Crescent Gardens. A spokeswoman said the co-owned facilities supported Canadian farmers by incorporating locally sourced ingredients and seasonal food into their “well-balanced” dishes. The vast majority of the homes — 200 of the 300 — spent between $7 and $9 a resident per day. Fraser Health oversees the largest number of seniors homes in the province, and also has the highest tally of low food budgets. All homes must meet the requirements of Canada’s Food Guide and have their menus approved by a dietitian, said a Fraser Health spokeswoman, Tasleem Juma. The health authority’s role is to examine how the home is self-monitoring key issues such as food audits, a minimum four-week menu cycle, and menu planning, Juma said. She would not comment on how some facilities can feed a resident for as low as $5 a day, but said cost can be reduced by factors such as buying power when purchasing a large amount of items. “If anyone is concerned about the quality of the food they or their loved one is receiving in residential care, we have a rigorous complaint process,” Juma said. “While we don’t receive many complaints regarding the food in residential care facilities, those we do get are typically related to variety or unaddressed dietary restrictions.” Normanna and its sister home Dania in Burnaby allocate about $8.50 a person each day, using bulk buying and other money-saving steps to create wholesome meals that cater to demand for such things as puréed foods and cultural dishes. “When a person comes into care, everything is foreign to them. The room is strange, the people are strange, they are going to be sitting with different people at the dining table. But looking at the food: Does the mac and cheese look like what I made at home? Is there fresh green beans on the dinner plate? That is where we can make a difference, giving them the familiarity of what they got at home,” said Stella Buttner, director of environment at the two facilities. “The better the meal looks, the more likely they are to eat it and enjoy it. And of course it is about the socialization. It is not just about the food on the plate, it is about the socialization at the dining table as well,” added executive director Penny Hill. “Nutrition is really important for any senior. It’s about everything. It’s about their skin integrity, it is about them being able to keep more mobile because, obviously, if they get all their vitamins and nutrients, it helps to keep their bone density good.” Tabesh, the homes’ chef, argues health authorities, which already fund these homes, should provide set menus and budgets so that meals taste good and don’t come from a can or a box. “(Even) the simplest thing: mashed potatoes. If you buy a russet potato and peel it — I know there is a bit of time in that — instead of an instant mashed potato, then your starch is much fresher just by spending a maximum of five cents per resident more,” he said. “Some facilities, they try to cut the budget, but a lower quality (of ingredients) really impacts the food. Fresh product will cost a bit more, maybe (jumping) from $6 to $8 per day, but it makes a huge difference.” Dr. Kenneth Tekano, regional program medical director of residential care for Vancouver Coastal Health, said homes should make every effort to improve the quality of life for people who are nearing the end of their lives. “The fact that these numbers are now being examined is good because I think it will shine a light on: Does that seem like a reasonable amount to offer someone for food? It doesn’t seem like enough to me,” Tekano said. “We need to invest more in improving the food quality.” lculbert@postmedia.com twitter.com/loriculbert A seven-part series: Part 1:How the system works (or doesn’t) Part 2:Wait times long for residential care Part 3:Home care support stretched thin Part 4 :The problems with residential care Part 5:Food and nutrition Part 6:Challenges for relatives providing care Part 7:Dementia patients and the B.C. system"
231,,"WASHINGTON — Viruses that sneak into the brain just might play a role in Alzheimer’s, scientists reported Thursday in a provocative study that promises to re-ignite some long-debated theories about what triggers the mind-robbing disease. The findings don’t prove viruses cause Alzheimer’s, nor do they suggest it’s contagious. But a team led by researchers at New York’s Mount Sinai Health System found that certain viruses — including two extremely common herpes viruses — affect the behaviour of genes involved in Alzheimer’s. The idea that infections earlier in life might somehow set the stage for Alzheimer’s decades later has simmered at the edge of mainstream medicine for years. It’s been overshadowed by the prevailing theory that Alzheimer’s stems from sticky plaques that clog the brain. Thursday’s study has even some specialists who never embraced the infection connection saying it’s time for a closer look, especially as attempts to block those so-called beta-amyloid plaques have failed. “With an illness this terrible, we cannot afford to dismiss all scientific possibilities,” said Dr. John Morris, who directs the Alzheimer’s research centre at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. He wasn’t involved in the new research but called it impressive. The study also fits with mounting evidence that how aggressively the brain’s immune system defends itself against viruses or other germs may be riskier than an actual infection, said Alzheimer’s specialist Dr. Rudolph Tanzi of Massachusetts General Hospital. With Harvard colleague Dr. Robert Moir, Tanzi has performed experiments showing that sticky beta-amyloid captures invading germs by engulfing them — and that’s why the plaque starts forming in the first place. The question remained, OK, in the Alzheimer brain what are the microbes that matter, what are the microbes that trigger the plaque? “The question remained, OK, in the Alzheimer brain what are the microbes that matter, what are the microbes that trigger the plaque?” explained Tanzi, who also had no role in the new research. The team from Mount Sinai and Arizona State University came up with some viral suspects — by accident. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, wasn’t hunting viruses but was looking for new drug targets for Alzheimer’s. The researchers were using complex genetic data from hundreds of brains at several brain banks to compare differences between people who’d died with Alzheimer’s and the cognitively normal. The first clues that viruses were around “came screaming out at us,” said Mount Sinai geneticist Joel Dudley, a senior author of the research published Thursday in the journal Neuron. The team found viral genetic material at far higher levels in Alzheimer’s-affected brains than in normal ones. Most abundant were two human herpes viruses, known as HHV6a and HHV7, that infect most people during childhood, often with no symptoms, and then lie dormant in the body. That wasn’t unusual. Since 1980, other researchers have linked a variety of bacteria and viruses, including another type of herpes that causes cold sores, to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s. But it was never clear if germs were merely bystanders, or actively spurring Alzheimer’s. The new study went farther: Researchers used computer models to check how the viral genes interacted with human genes, proteins and amyloid buildup, almost like the viruses’ social media connections, Dudley explained. “We’re able to see if viral genes are friending some of the host genes and if they tweet, who tweets back,” Dudley said. They found a lot of interactions, suggesting the viruses could even switch on and off Alzheimer’s-related genes. To see if those interactions mattered, the researchers bred mice lacking one molecule that herpes seemed to deplete. Sure enough, the animals developed more of those amyloid plaques. “I look at this paper and it makes me sit up and say, ‘Wow,”‘ said Alzheimer’s Association scientific programs director Keith Fargo. He said the research makes a viral connection much more plausible but cautioned that the study won’t affect how today’s patients are treated. If the findings pan out, they could change how scientists look for new ways to treat or prevent Alzheimer’s, said Dr. Miroslaw Mackiewicz of NIH’s National Institute on Aging. Already, NIH is funding a first-step study to see if an antiviral drug benefits people who have both mild Alzheimer’s and different herpes viruses. Just having a herpes virus “does not mean you’re going to get Alzheimer’s,” Mass General’s Tanzi stressed. It may not even have penetrated the brain. But in another study soon to be published, Tanzi showed biologically how both HHV6 and a cold sore-causing herpes virus can trigger or “seed” amyloid plaque formation, supporting the Mount Sinai findings. Still, he doesn’t think viruses are the only suspects. “The Mount Sinai paper tells us the viral side of the story. We still have to work out the microbe side of the story,” said Tanzi, who is looking for bacteria and other bugs in what’s called the Brain Microbiome Project. “The brain was always thought to be a sterile place. It’s absolutely not true.” The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

232,"Jun 20, 2018","Most seniors in B.C. still live independently at home, where cooking — often for just themselves — can seem like a hassle. “That’s a challenge for many people, young and old alike,” said Rachel Murphy, an assistant professor at UBC’s faculty of medicine who has an expertise in aging and nutrition. Simple solutions, like eating a tin of soup with a piece of toast, won’t provide the nutrients needed for aging bodies. So, Murphy has some advice on how to cook small meals and still get big nourishment. “Planning can help minimize the challenge of shopping and cooking for seniors. Planning what you are going to make for the week and checking local flyers can help save time and money. Ordering groceries or seeing if your grocery offers delivery can save time and energy of shopping, or plan to go shopping with a friend to share transportation costs and larger grocery items,” she said. “When it comes to recipes, try choosing some that have common ingredients, for example multiple recipes that have carrots or chicken so that ingredients don’t go to waste… Canned (packed in water, not syrup) or frozen fruits and vegetables have similar nutritional benefits as fresh and last much longer.” Label and freeze unused ingredients in single portion sizes, plan next-day meals that can use up left-overs (such as omelettes, casseroles and soups), and share cooking with friends, Murphy added. Exercise is also important because it stimulates appetite in slim seniors, and encourages fitness in those who are more plump. “There are two challenges in the seniors population: to try to maintain a healthy weight, and on the other side there are the seniors who are losing weight,” Murphy said. Older people who live alone should have someone checking in on whether they are eating properly, especially those with dementia who can forget to eat, said Sandra Galbraith, director of a private Langley-based care aid company, Cornerstone Care. “Food safety can be an issue too because they do have food in the home, but something will sit in the fridge for weeks and then they will go to eat it. I know our care aides are in the house and they are looking for that stuff,” said Galbraith, whose staff will also cook for their clients. “It’s so important that they are getting at least a couple of balanced meals a day.” The provincial government has produced a 200-page guidebook,Healthy Eating for Seniors, in four languages (English, French, Chinese and Punjabi), with many tips and recipes. Among them: • Seven servings of vegetables and fruit. • Six servings (women) and seven servings (men) of grain products, such as bread, rice, pasta, cereals. • Three servings of milk and alternatives, such as cheese, yogurt, kefir and fortified soy beverages. • Two servings (women) and three servings (men) of meat (cooked fish, shellfish, poultry, lean meat) and meat alternatives, such as eggs, beans, lentils, chickpeas, tofu, nuts and nut butters. • Nine eight-ounce glasses (2.2 litres) of water/fluids for women, and 12 eight-ounce glasses (three litres) for men. • Saturated fats (found in butter, lard, deli meats, bacon and sausages). • Trans fats (found in processed foods, cookies, cakes and deep-fried items). • Refined grains. • Salt and sugar (including sugary drinks as well as jams, candies and baked goods). • Many seniors do not get enough calcium, folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and vitamin C through the food they eat. • Vitamins can help prevent anemia, depression and memory loss; promote healing after surgery or an injury; and keep bones and teeth strong. • Heart disease, high cholesterol, and other common ailments can be partially controlled through healthy eating. • Use bagged, pre-washed greens and pre-cut vegetables. • Visit the deli for items like lean turkey and lean roast beef or barbecue chicken. • Keep bread in the freezer, taking out one or two slices at a time. It will last up to three months. • Buy from the bulk food bins. • Replace big, family-style cooking utensils with smaller pots and casserole dishes. Food will cook more quickly and the clean up will be easier. • Use simple recipes like adding tofu cubes to cooked noodles, stir in leftover vegetables, and bake. • Or add a hard-boiled egg or tin of tuna, plus leftover vegetables, to macaroni andcheese. lculbert@postmedia.com A seven-part series: Part 1:How the system works (or doesn’t) Part 2 (June 18):Wait times long for residential care Part 3 (June 19):Home care support stretched thin Part 4 (June 20):The problems with residential care Part 5 (June 21):Food and nutrition Part 6 (June 22):Challenges for relatives providing care Part 7 (June 23):Dementia patients and the B.C. system"
233,"Jun 19, 2018","The crossword on Dennise Keefe’s door is a nine-word autobiography: His friendChrissaved his life, he was a short-ordercook, he lovesrock‘n’rollmusic, he’s a whiz atcards, and he makescoffeeevery morning at his long-term residential-care facility. “It makes me feel really good,” said Keefe, proudly pointing out the ZZ Top posters and high-scoring cribbage hand also taped to his blue door. In Vancouver’s Youville seniors home, staff recently helped residents decorate their doors as part of a “megamorphosis” movement by Providence Health Care to make these facilities look more like a home. “If you enter into many facilities for residential care, or care homes, these days you might think you are in a hospital, and that is not really a place you want to spend the end of your life,” said Dr. Ken Tekano, Providence’s head of residence care. “So within the constraints of the physical space, we are trying to shift the model from a medical model to a social model. And that is the way of the future, from our perspective.” Recent data collected by the B.C. seniors advocate, Isobel Mackenzie, indicates socialization must be improved in most of B.C.’s 293 residential care homes. Even though these retirees live with many people, nearly half say they feel isolated and have little social engagement when it comes to interacting with other residents and taking part in activities. Indeed this was an area where Youville — a specialized home catering to residents with challenging behaviours, which also has a mental health unit for older adults — needed improvement when Mackenzie gathered her statistics in 2016-17. Nearly 75 per cent of residents reported feeling isolated then. Today in Youville, quilts, fancy hats and painted flowers adorn the walls that lead to the personalized doors, which provide a small introduction to the person who lives inside. Staff painted “A good looking piano man lives here” on the front of Roy Vowels’s green door, prompting a recent visitor to ask him about music. While he shyly talked about his mother teaching him to play and about being in a band, it is clear he is very modest about his musical accomplishments — and his looks. This inexpensive progem has been done at two Providence residential homes, and the intent is to expand it to the rest, Tekano said. Loneliness can be as bad for your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day,some studies have shown, and is a topic families may want to raise searching for a home for a loved one. “Ask what kinds of recreational programs the home has. How many staff? How many active volunteers a facility has. What does the calendar of events look like? Are there things happening here that are of interest to my relative?” are questions suggested by Jennifer Baumbusch, a UBC assistant professor in nursing and an expert in long-term residential care. “Also look at the physical environment, talk to residents as you walk through to see if they are engaged and happy and doing things they like.” Earlier this year, Mackenziereleased a reportbased on information she gathered for all B.C. care facilities, which have 27,142 publicly subsidized beds, and offersan online tool(at seniorsadvocatebc.ca/quickfacts/) to look up stats on each home. Postmedia analyzed the raw data collected by Mackenzie, and below looks at several other key areas of concern. Care hours While Mackenzie and others have long lobbied for an average of 3.36 direct hours of care every day for each senior in a residential home, her figures show the average in 2016-17 was 3.14 hours, a slight improvement over the previous year. While all facilities receive funding from health authorities, two-thirds are run by private companies and only four per cent of those get enough money to provide the full 3.36 hours of care. The rest of the homes are run by the health authorities and one third of those are able to reach that goal. Indeed, more than 60 facilities across B.C. are cutting their residents short by a half-hour or more every day — that’s 30 minutes less help for bathing, dressing or just having a conversation. Baumbusch, the UBC expert, said it’s unfortunate this disparity exists in a system in which people waiting for residential care must go to the first facility with an available bed, and then remain on waiting lists for other places they may prefer. “I don’t think it’s fair to people moving into a first-available-bed system: ‘You are going to go wherever we put you, but we can’t promise you a staffing level,’” she said. “I think with so many aspects of seniors care, the planning for this large cohort of older adults hasn’t really happened. It has never been prioritized to the point where they have the services in place.” The year-old NDP government has made the problem priority and has budgeted $240 million to hire 1,500 more care aides and nurses by the end of 2021 to get those care hours up to an average of 3.36 at every home, Health Minister Adrian Dix said. This, of course, will not address the increasing demand for more residential care, but will address the needs of people already in care. Daniel Fontaine, head of the B.C. Care Providers Association, said some homes have started to receive this funding, in particular the privately run facilities with the lowest hours. But both Fontaine and Dix agree money isn’t the biggest challenge: It’s where to find all the care aides they need to hire, especially in rural communities and the North, where it has traditionally been harder to recruit staff. “This could take years to implement. And we are beyond just talking about the aging population, we are in the middle of it,” said Fontaine, whose organization represents privately run care homes. Last fall, he presented the government with a proposal on how to train more care aides, which involved unions, colleges and high-school job-training programs. Fontaine hopes to hear some commitment soon from the ministry on this plan. Falls with injuries and restraint use Holy Family Residence in South Vancouver has started a program believed to be the first of its kind in Canada: Community volunteers interact with seniors in the home daily between 4 and 7 p.m., a time period in which residents were having falls most often. Twenty-one “fallunteers,” including Preet Mangat, help residents reach items so they don’t lose their balance or play board games with them so they are less restless in the evenings. “We are trying to prevent falls with having an extra pair of hands around,” said Mangat, 19, a UBC biochemistry student. Falls with injuries is one of the categories analyzed by Mackenzie. On average, for every 100 beds in a facility, there were 10 times when someone fell and got hurt in 2016-17. That number was over 20 falls per 100 beds in 25 of the homes. Holy Family’s rate was relatively low, at 3.5 injuries from falls for every 100 beds, but the facility hopes to get it even lower. The fallunteer program began as a research project in 2016, and expanded in September to three volunteers interacting with more than 100 residents each evening. There is equipment that facilities can use to reduce injuries from falls, such as specialized lighting at night, beds that can be lowered to the ground, and shorts with padding around the hips, said Baumbusch. She encourages families to ask facilities about these options, and if there is any cost to the resident. Mackenzie’s report found physical restraints — which she defines as something that holds “limb and trunk” and the use of reclining chairs that prohibit getting up — are also sometimes used to reduce falls. An average of eight per cent of seniors in residential care had daily physical restraints between October 2016 and September 2017, down from nine per cent the year before. Tekano, who is also regional medical director of residential care for the Vancouver Coastal region, strongly objected to the idea that nursing home residents are being bound to beds or chairs today. Instead, the type of “restraint” that might be used includes a lap tray, wheelchair seatbelt, bed rail, or a wheelchair that tips backwards, he said. He said residential care is moving toward allowing people as much freedom to move as possible, but noted some families are worried about their loved ones being at risk of falling. “It is truly bordering on cruel to prevent someone from mobilizing who can (walk),” he said. Baumbusch said restraints such as table trays and seatbelts can be over-used when staffing is low in a home. “I don’t think any of us can imagine sitting in the same for spot hours on end. We always have to put ourselves in the position and ask: Would this be acceptable to me?” she said, adding families should tour facilities they are interested in. “I would look to see if residents are up and walking and mobilizing on their own, or is everyone in a wheelchair with their feet up on foot pedals?” Antipsychotics Another area of concern for Mackenzie is the use of antipsychotic medications in residents who don’t have adiagnosis ofpsychosis. She found this was happening with a whopping 25 per cent of residents in 2016/17, down from 27 per cent the year before. “It’s a desperate effort to help the care staff deal with ‘disinhibited’ behaviours from folks suffering from dementia,” Tekano said when asked about the off-label use of these medications. “Typically these medicines are started in response to some sort of crisis situation.” Seniors might, for example, act out because they’re frustrated by an inability to communicate, he said, so the medication can be used to suppress that behaviour — perhaps because staff don’t have the time to understand the behaviour. In 10 of the province’s residential care homes, 50 per cent or more of the residents are being given antipsychotics without a proper diagnosis. Two of the worst offenders are in the Vancouver Coastal region that Tekano oversees, but he said the statistics are skewed in those facilities because they are referral centres for people with challenging behaviours and psychiatric conditions. Fontaine, of the B.C. Care Providers Association, said one of the biggest challenges for the homes is that seniors coming out of acute care are often “on a basket of drugs,” which can be hard to wean off. Both he and Tekano believe increasing care hours and education will help to continue the downward trend Mackenzie found in reliance on these meds. “We are making progress. We are not where we want to be, definitely, but I like where the numbers are going,” Fontaine said. lculbert@postmedia.com A seven-part series: Part 1:How the system works (or doesn’t) Part 2:Wait times long for residential care Part 3:Home care support stretched thin Part 4:The problems with residential care Part 5 :Food and nutrition Part 6:Challenges for relatives providing care Part 7:Dementia patients and the B.C. system"
234,,"Wayne Greggain lived at Sechelt Hospital five months, but not because he needed treatment. Unable to walk and sliding into dementia, the former mill worker languished on a waiting list for residential care on the lower Sunshine Coast. Greggain went into the hospital for a brain biopsy on Oct. 12 last year, after months of neurological symptoms and increasing fatigue. Until then, his wife Liz Szymanski-Greggain struggled to care for him at home, with only one hour a week of homecare assistance. He was eventually diagnosed with cerebral amyloid angiopathy with inflammation of the brain, which is largely untreatable. “The biopsy was very hard on him and he couldn’t walk or stand after that, even after weeks of physiotherapy at Lions Gate Hospital,” she said. “It took three people to get him up to exercise.” His quick decline after the biopsy made returning home impossible, but the area’s residential care facilities are full. Residential care provides 24-hour nursing to people who cannot be cared for at home. So Greggain was in limbo at Sechelt Hospital, paying about $1,000 a month for his care. How long people are stranded is hard to predict because residential care waiting lists are not first-come, first-served. Placement in residential care is determined by a detailed assessment of each client’s need for daily support, access to assistance and other criteria including spousal unification, time spent on the waiting list, transfers to a preferred facility and whether the client is in a hospital bed rather than living in the community. Patients with special needs may need to wait for a bed with the appropriate support. Greggain was finally admitted to Totem Lodge and greeted by a number of patients he came to know while they were all stuck in Sechelt Hospital. Sadly, there is nothing unusual about his story. In the Northern and Vancouver Island Health regions and in rural pockets across the province, hundreds of acute care hospital beds are occupied by people who should be in residential care. Residential care is for people who require 24-hour medical supervision, mainly near the end of their lives. The median stay is about 450 days. About two thirds of seniors accepted for residential care in B.C. are admitted to the so-called first appropriate bed within 30 days. But in some regions, the wait can be long. In the Vancouver Coastal Health region, half of eligible seniors are placed in six days or less. In the Northern Health region, the average wait is 73 days. On Vancouver Island, the average wait was 62 days last year. While the numbers fluctuate, about 400 hospital beds are occupied by people who are no longer receiving treatment while they await placement, according to theseniors advocate’s monitoring report. Proportionally, the numbers are highest in the North and on Vancouver Island. A handful of communities in the Coastal Health region— like the Sunshine Coast — also struggle to accommodate seniors who cannot care for themselves in a timely way. Vancouver Coastal Health has an agreement with Trellis Seniors Services to build and operate a privately owned, publicly funded residential care home. The project is intended to replace two aging facilities — Totem Lodge and Shorncliffe in Sechelt — and to also add 20 new beds. Thirteen people are waiting for residential care in Sechelt and nearby Gibsons, according to the health authority. But the project has become a political football and a focal point for protest in the community and by unionized staff at the government-owned facilities to be shut down. Opponents consider privately run facilities inferior to those staffed by government workers. When the District of Sechelt dragged its feet approving a site for the new facility, Trellis was welcomed by Gibsons. But that would have left no beds in Sechelt. Health Minister Adrian Dix has since announced a deal with the Sechelt First Nation to build on their land. Access to residential care and assisted living in B.C. has declined by 20 per cent over the past 16 years, as measured by the number of beds relative to the population aged 75 and older, according to a 2017 report by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. Access to home support has declined 30 per cent over the same period. Though more seniors receive care at home, they each receive fewer visits by workers, according to the reportPrivatization and Declining Access to B.C. Senior’s Care. The waiting times for placement in assisted living and residential care dropped modestly last year, but Isobel Mackenzie, the seniors advocate, is concerned that the growth in residential care spaces is not keeping pace with our aging population. “While there has been a 1.5 per cent increase in subsidized residential care beds since last year, the population aged 75-plus increased by 3.5 per cent,” according to Mackenzie. Fraser Health led the way, adding 294 new residential spaces last year. The Northern Health region added just one, while the number of publicly funded beds in Vancouver Coastal dropped by 24. In Vancouver Coastal, there are 113 people waiting for residential care, 37 of them in acute care hospital beds, according to the Health Authority. “There is only going to be more demand,” said Health Minister Adrian Dix. “This is why we have to take action on home and community care.” For patients, it’s a waiting game. “Two whole floors of our hospital are full of people who should be in a care home,” said Szymanski-Greggain. “Think of the difference that would make to the hospital.” rshore@postmedia.com A seven-part series: Part 1:How the system works (or doesn’t) Part 2:Wait times long for residential care Part 3:Home care support stretched thin Part 4:The problems with residential care Part 5:Food and nutrition Part 6:Challenges for relatives providing care Part 7:Dementia patients and the B.C. system CLICK HEREto report a typo.

235,,"Moira Hewitt has lived on her own for the past eight years and she is quite determined to carry on, thank you very much. As age and her battle with multiple sclerosis progress, she needs help to get her day started, prep meals and get to bed. Now using a wheelchair full-time, Hewitt can no longer leave her garden flat on her own. “I’m not a quitter … like the Energizer bunny,” she declared. “When I first moved in (19 years ago) I could still walk and then I was using a cane. Slowly it goes downhill. It doesn’t rule me, I just carry on.” But as her needs have grown, her hours of care are being reduced and a hefty bill is attached. She is not alone. The average number of home support hours per client in B.C. has dropped by three per cent and the number of clients increased by 3.5 per cent, just in the past year, according toa report released in Decemberby Isobel Mackenzie, the B.C. seniors advocate. Since 2010, Hewitt has received four visits a day for just under an hour each, subsidized by the provincial government because her income is low. But when RRSP rules compelled her to start deregistering her savings last year, her income jumped to $52,000 and her subsidy was reduced. That means the care she received at no charge for years now costs her almost $1,700 a month, about 40 per cent of her income. Adding insult, in February, her care hours were cut, even though her physical needs have not changed. Hewitt gets on the toilet just before 10 a.m. and waits for her morning worker to arrive and help her off the throne. “If I could get off the toilet on my own, I’d be just fine,” she said. But as determined as she is, Hewitt probably needs more help than that. Three more visits — at 3 p.m., 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. — have been cut from 50 minutes to 30 minutes and have ranged to as low as 20 minutes. “I feel like the girls are under a lot of stress, rushing around,” said Hewitt. “They are supposed to walk away from a task if it’s not done, but most of the girls have a heart, so they can be a little flexible.” While hour-long home care visits allowed Hewitt’s workers to take her outdoors to visit the carp pond on the grounds of her complex, those days appear to be over. “They are rushed, so now I am cooped up inside all the time,” she said. “It’s two minutes away, but I can’t get there.” People with moderate to complex chronic conditions tend to be heavy users of hospital, pharmacare and community care services. The number of people with these conditions is expected to increase about 70 per cent by 2036, according toMinistry of Health projections. Home care services include such things as in-home support with bathing, dressing, medications and toileting, and home visits by nurses, physiotherapists and other health care professionals, all with an eye to helping seniors live safely at home longer. The idea is to reduce demand for assisted living and residential care beds, according to Health Minister Adrian Dix. But lately, giving everyone the care they need is a bit like spreading one spoonful of jam on an ever-growing piece of toast. Things are looking a bit thin. Complaints associated with home care service providers — nurses, therapists and home support workers — rose 23.5 per cent over the past year, according to the B.C. seniors advocate. If home care proves inadequate, Hewitt will consider hiring live-in help rather than move to an assisted living facility, which is supportive housing for people with moderate levels of disability who require daily personal assistance to live independently. “I’m not ready for assisted living,” she said, with a sour look. “I don’t really want a live-in because your life isn’t your own.” The government wants seniors to stay in their own homes for as long as possible, said Dix. “Well, they aren’t making it any easier and there are a lot of seniors in my position,” Hewitt said. Hewitt has been offered advice on how to get some household chores done by contacting community groups, according to Fraser Health. Services such as meals and laundry are not supposed to be completed by support workers. A larger percentage of seniors are receiving home care services than 16 years ago, but on average each receives fewer hours of care by health care professionals, according toan analysis by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. The system serves about 87,000 clients, up from 53,000 in 2001, an increase of 64 per cent. The number of client visits has increased only 26 per cent over that time, according to the analysis. And there are serious regional disparities. While access to services for people 75 and over increased in the Interior, it declined dramatically in the Northern Health region where that age group is growing fast, the report says. To address the shortfall, the provincial government will fund the hiring of about 900 care aides and nearly 500 other medical professionals in part to improve home care and increase the number of hours available for home health care monitoring. Last February’s budget also included $116 million over three years for the Rental Assistance Program and the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) program, which includes an increase in the income ceiling for the program from $35,000 to $40,000. SAFER will apply to thousands more households under the new rules and the benefit itself will also rise by more than $900 a year, said Dix. rshore@postmedia.com A seven-part series: Part 1:How the system works (or doesn’t) Part 2:Wait times long for residential care Part 3:Home care support stretched thin Part 4:The problems with residential care Part 5:Food and nutrition Part 6:Challenges for relatives providing care Part 7:Dementia patients and the B.C. system"
236,"Jun 18, 2018","Dr. Roger Wong’s memories of his grandmother include her favourite song, Moon River, and the way she used to cook his favourite dish, spot prawns in sweet tomato sauce. He and his grandmother were close, he said, until his family left Hong Kong and moved to Canada when he was in Grade 12. But it is the memory of his grandma’s twilight years at a care facility in Hong Kong — where she lived in a room lined with steel cots — that has animated Wong’s life’s work: To help seniors maintain their independence, stay healthy and live at home as long as possible. “The key thing is to act before it’s too late,” said Wong, a geriatric doctor and professor of geriatric medicine at the University of B.C. Aging doesn’t automatically mean moving into a care facility, he noted. Even seniors with dementia or Alzheimer’s who are in the early or moderate phase of the disease can live at home. In Canada, over 90 per cent of people age 65 and older stay in their homes and communities, according to Statistics Canada. Among seniors in their 90s, about half lived in private households. Helping seniors age in place is less costly in the long run than putting seniors in residential care homes or assisted living facilities. Most importantly, it’s what most seniors want, said Denise Cloutier, a health geographer at the University of Victoria. For older people to stay at home, they need access to housing, transportation and services that help them stay connected to their communities, such as doctors’ clinics, recreational clubs, community centres, churches or parks, she said. As more baby boomers turn 65 and older, they are reinventing aging. They are more proactive in seeking help and pursuing accommodations for aging in place. Cloutier said boomers may be attracted to housing forms such as townhouses or co-housing communities, where residents own properties constructed around a common space with shared amenities. She also predicted a boom in services such as meal-delivery or home maintenance services. Because half of all falls that result in hospitalization occur at home, age-proofing the home is key to allowing seniors to stay at home longer. Wong, for example, has convinced his mother to remove loose rugs, decorative tables and other tripping hazards. “Pretty simple stuff.” Socialization is also important, experts say. The effects of loneliness and social isolation is the health equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, said Wong, who encourages seniors to join clubs, take up a hobby, and embrace technology, including social media, to stay connected. Other practical tips to age-proof your home: • Retrofitting your home may be costly up front, but it could save money in the long haul. Some seniors are eligible for provincial and federal tax credits, such as the B.C.Home Renovation Tax Credit,Home Adaptations for Independenceand the federalHome Accessibility Tax Credit. • Reduce or eliminate stairs. • Make sure outdoor stairs or decks have railings and good traction on surfaces. • Create a well-lit home. Install switches at the top and bottom of stairs, night lights between the bedroom and bathroom, or motion-sensor lights. • Remove tripping hazards such as rugs, cords and clutter. • Have non-slip surfaces in the tub or shower. Consider installing a bath seat and hand-held shower heads to allow seniors to take a shower sitting down. Install grab bars that are well-anchored to the wall in the bath or shower or near the toilet seat. • Discard furniture that feels loose or wobbly. • Rearrange cabinets and pantry so commonly used items are easy to reach. Install lower shelves to improve access. • Program a senior’s cellphone with emergency phone numbers. • Use an emergency personal response system like Lifeline, which provides a call button that can be worn around the neck or the wrist that seniors can press to call for help. • Consider using internet-based smart tech that can track daily living patterns of residents using motion sensors and can send an alert to a remote smart phone or social media app. • Seniors who own their home are eligible for the homeowner grant, which reduces property taxes paid on a principal residence. They can also defer all or part of their taxes to be paid with interest once the property is sold or the homeowner dies. • Low-income seniors who are renters may be eligible for a rent supplement through theShelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) program. —Sources:Seniors First B.C.,B.C.

238,"May 28, 2018","A Toronto hospital’s new hip-replacement technique is allowing some patients to leave the hospital the day of the operation. A surgeon at St. Michaels Hospital says the approach signifies a new ideology for the surgery. Unlike more traditional hip replacements, with incisions to reach the joint through either a patient’s side or back, Dr. Amir Khoshbin is performing the operation through the front and using a special surgical table to aid that approach. The benefit is that patients begin recovering more quickly and are able to go home the same day as the surgery, instead of needing to be admitted for at least a day or two, as is usually the case. "
239,"May 02, 2018","Dani and Lizzy Nelson, twin singers from Vancouver, just wanted to recognize the work of a nurse who’d cared for an ailing fan of theirs. Wednesday, viewers of NBC’s Today show were treated to a special rendition of the duo’sviral hit song Dancing in the Sky. (As of Wednesday afternoon, Lizzy’s 2013 rendition had been played 23 million times on Youtube.) Dani and Lizzy had travelled to a Nashville hospital to sing for nurse Olivia Neufeld and Megan and Cristal Smith. Neufelder works at the transplant unit at Vanderbilt hospital. Neufelder’s rendition of the Dani and Lizzy song also went viral last fall. She was singing the song for a patient named Margaret Smith, who was a huge fan of the song. Smith’s daughter Megan and granddaughter Cristal recorded a video of Neufelder singing to Smith as she lay in her hospital bed. She would die two days later, after a tough fight against liver cancer. Smith had told Neufelder it was her favourite song so the 23 year old learned the song and sang it to her,she told The Washington Post. The younger Smiths were so touched by how Neufelder had comforted Margaret that they shared the video on social media. It’s since been viewed more than 50 million times, Today reported Wednesday. The Nelsons heard the story, got in touch with Today, and arranged to surprise the trio at the hospital. “We saw (Neufelder) singing,” Dani Nelson told Postmedia on Wednesday. “It had been shared by a lot of our fans. They’d send it to us and they’d say ‘have you seen this story?'” “When we finally watched it we reached out. We wanted to sing at Margaret’s funeral but we weren’t able to because of our schedules. So we got in touch with Today.” The Smiths and Neufelder were taken to a room where the Nelsons were ready to greet them and then sing the song. After the five women embraced, the Nelsons were already feeling emotional. And they still had to sing. “I thought ‘don’t cry,'” Nelson said of what she was thinking as they began their performance. “I was trying so hard not to cry.” “We were five feet from them, they were so emotional. We were in that same hospital where Margaret had been. We just wanted to do the best job that we could.” While the Today cameras were rolling, the twins explained to Neufelder why they were there. “We wanted to come thank you. And to just say how touched we were for how far you went above and beyond. We hope that we would all be in that kind of care,” Dani said. The moment brought everyone in the room to tears. “It’s just continued to amaze us how far the song has travelled, how many people it’s touched,” Nelson said. “The fact it’s still being used so often by people at funeral and memorials…it’s just completely overwhelming. We never expected it in a million years.” After the song, the Nelsons chatted with Neufelder and the Smiths. “We just hung around in that room for a while, chatting,” Nelson recalled. “They told us stories of what Margaret was saying, of what the song meant to her, that she wanted to meet them. Afterwards, the Nelsons and the Smiths went out for dinner. “It was so special that (Today) wanted to honour Olivia for what she did,” she said. “We could only imagine that we’d be in such good hands. She’s such an good nurse. She’s very dedicated to her work. “I was honoured to be able to recognize her.” "

Nabi Tajima died in a hospital Saturday evening in the town of Kikai in southern Japan, town official Susumu Yoshiyuki said. She had been hospitalized since January. Tajima, born on Aug. 4, 1900, was the last known person born in the 19th century. She raised seven sons and two daughters and reportedly had more than 160 descendants, including great-great-great grandchildren. She became the world’s oldest person after the death in September of Violet Brown of Jamaica, also at the age of 117. Video on Japanese television showed Tajima moving her hands to the beat of music played on traditional Japanese instruments at a ceremony to mark the achievement. The world's oldest person, Japanese native Nabi Tajima, died at the age of 117 on Saturday; the world record for oldest person is now passed to fellow Japanese native, Chiyo Yoshidapic.twitter.com/BFHIT6dbAL Tajima’s town of Kikai is a small island of about 7,000 people halfway between Okinawa and Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan’s four main islands. The U.S.-based Gerontology Research Group says that another Japanese woman, Chiyo Miyako, is now the world’s oldest person. Miyako lives in Kanagawa prefecture, south of Tokyo, and turns 117 on May 2.

241,"Apr 10, 2018","In 2016, everyone from the chief medical health officer to the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons linked the growing epidemic of drug overdoses to doctors having over-prescribed opioids. They pointed to the United States where there were high-profile convictions in Washington, California and Florida of doctors and pharmacists who illegally diverted Oxycontin to drug traffickers and addicts. More generally, they pointed to research that suggests eight per cent of the population is at risk of some form of addiction. And there were whispers about ordinary people selling their leftover or unwanted drugs to dealers or junkies. But there was no evidence that over-prescribing was driving the crisis then and there’s no evidence of it now. “We certainly haven’t found to date that there is a link between doctors’ prescription and illicit deaths,” Michael Egilson said in an interview. Egilson chaired the B.C. Coroner’s death review panel that investigated 1,854 overdose deaths in B.C. between Jan. 1, 2016 and July 31, 2017. He said that panel members had all heard stories about chronic pain sufferers self-medicating by buying street drugs and dying. But there was no proof. “To date, the B.C. experience has been primarily driven by illicit fentanyl. Some other provinces and jurisdictions have made more of a link and a narrative out of there is prescribing practices. But we haven’t found that’s what the issue is here.” Illicit fentanyl was the cause of the earliest deaths that the panel looked at. Now, Egilson said, the toxicology reports show that fentanyl is found in 80 per cent of those who have died. But he was careful to add that the panel only looked at overdose deaths. It didn’t look at the 25 to 50 “non-fatal, near-miss events.” Regardless, the B.C. College of Physicians had acted swiftly. In 2016, it brought in prescription standards and became the first in North America to threaten to revoke doctors’ licences if they didn’t comply or fine them up to $100,000. With little choice, some doctors cut back on prescriptions for chronic pain sufferers, causing them to suffer withdrawal, unremitting pain and thoughts about suicide. Others “fired” patients with chronic pain and refused to take on new patients with chronic pain. Some walk-in clinics posted signs saying that their doctors do not prescribe opiates. At the time, Dr. Owen Williamson said it was causing “chaos” and “mayhem” for both doctors and their patients with lupus, arthritis, fibromyalgia, spinal bifida, pain from accidents. Williamson is the president of the B.C. Pain Medicine Specialists Association. The College brought in the measures even though the provincial Health Ministry’s figures indicated that between 2011 and 2016, the number of British Columbians prescribed opioids had dropped by 1.8 per cent even though the population had increased by one per cent and the percentage of seniors (who have the highest rates of opioid prescriptions) had increased. Of course, in the heat of the crisis, British Columbia’s medical leaders weren’t the only ones who got it wrong. Last month, researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention admitted that it had “significantly inflated” the number of deaths linked to prescription opioids in 2016. Rather than the 32,445 overdose deaths attributed to prescription opioids in 2016, they concluded that it was 17,087. The error resulted from prescription opioid-involved deaths being tallied with deaths resulting from illegally manufactured fentanyl. The CDC is now taking a more conservative approach, the researchers said in a paper published in the American Journal of Public Health. That new approach will “better differentiate deaths involving prescription (pharmaceutically manufactured) opioids from deaths involving illicit opioids (heroin and illegally manufactured fentanyl).” What the death panel’s report highlights the complicated lives that most overdose victims have led. Eighty per cent were regular users of illicit drugs and 81 per cent were men. Two-thirds had spent time in jail. Most had more than one drug in their systems when they died. Most died alone at home. More than half had recently spent time in emergency. Many have tried and failed to kick their habit, which only made them more vulnerable to overdosing on opiates when they relapsed. This is all valuable information on which to base public policy decisions about how best to deal with the ongoing crisis. It’s also information that could have spared British Columbia’s 800,000 chronic pain sufferers from even more agony and their doctors’ from the stress of having to choose between treating patients the best way they knew how and complying with the College’s diktat. Perhaps now would be a good time for the College and others in leadership positions to rebuild bridges with doctors and the one-in-five people with chronic pain by supporting their calls for a separate and serious conversation about how to meet their complex needs. dbramham@postmedia.com"
242,"Mar 27, 2018","An 80-year old double amputee, who spent her last months between a Nanaimo hospital and a nursing home, was in so much pain that a highly distinguished palliative care doctor was consulted on ways to make her daily wound care dressing changes more tolerable with narcotics like morphine. But Thomas William Sanders, the son of Arleane (also known as Eileen) Sanders, had a health representation agreement on behalf of his mother and wouldn’t consent to heavy-duty pain medications for her. He later indicated in court documents that he thought the staff at Nanaimo Seniors Village only wanted to “overmedicate” her so she’d be in a vegetative state and hence, not a nuisance to caregivers. Dr. Robin Love, an internationally recognized palliative care doctor, was brought in to see the patient. Love, who has been honoured with numerous awards, overruled Sanders and prescribed a fentanyl patch and other medications for his mother. Eileen Sanders died on March 22, 2015. Her son had gotten the representation agreement the year before his mom died from complications of her peripheral vascular disease. Sanders’ end of life experiences have played out in numerous legal hearings for three years because her son has filed complaints to every authority he could, starting with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C. which dismissed his complaint about Love, finding he was diligent and attentive. In fact, the same year the College dealt with the Sanders complaint, it awarded Love with an Excellence in Medical Practice award for his tireless advocacy and creation of a palliative care service in Nanaimo. The Health Professionals Review Board (HPRB) also did an investigation after a complaint from Sanders and found no fault with what the College decided. Sanders also complained to the Vancouver Island Patient Care Quality Review Board, which concluded in 2016 that it may not have been right to override Sanders’ health care representation agreement but medical professionals were “acting in your mother’s best interest.” The hospital should have involved the Public Guardian and Trustee, the board recommended. The board also found that medical personnel need more training for dealing with end of life patients “to determine the appropriate protocols surrounding informed consent and revocation of a representation agreement.” Still dissatisfied, Sanders took his complaint to the Supreme Court of B.C. in 2017, asking it to quash the HPRB decision which found that Love did not breach his obligations by overriding Sanders. The court reserved its decision after a three-day hearing last fall in Victoria buthas now issued its decision, ruling againstSanders. Noting that Sanders appeared to be a “dutiful” son who regularly visited his mother, Supreme Court Judge Michael Brundrett said Sanders’ contended that morphine medication caused his mother to have delirium and contributed to her lack of appetite. Love met with Sanders and tried to explain that some of his mother’s confusion had to do with her progressive disease. In March, 2015, the patient was admitted, for the final time, to Nanaimo Regional General Hospital. She had a large, infected,gaping cavity in her peri-anal and rectal areabecause of an untreatable wound. The judge said nurses were “distressed and tearful” because they didn’t know how they could comfort Sanders given that her son would not consent to an increase or change in pain medications. At that point, Love said he would try changing pain medications on a trial basis to see if Sanders’ mental clarity improved. But on the morning of March 6, matters came to a head, the judge noted. Sanders was “yelling, crying and calling for help.” Despite Love’s 24 years as a palliative care physician, he was as distressed as the nurses. He called Thomas Sanders son to explain his mother was dying and needed better medications for her suffering but Sanders stuck to his position. So Love said he would take the necessary steps to overrule him. Sanders indicated to Love that he would consult a lawyer. At various legal hearings, Love said he consulted with a hospitalist, general surgeon, plastic surgeon and geriatric psychiatrist about the case. He also talked to various executives of the hospital, most notably the risk management department which advised that he could override the representation agreement if it was in the patient’s best interests. Sanders and Love had a meeting at the hospital. The physician told Sanders he could no longer watch what was happening, that nurses were traumatized by having to care for someone with such “unsurvivable” wounds and that his ethics and morals mandated that he provide proper pain medication which he went ahead and did. The patient died two days later. What Love did not know is that an angry, frustrated Sanders had already filed a complaint with the College about Love’s care for his mother and over-ruling his wishes and instructions. Judge Brundrett said doctors aren’t held to a standard of perfection by the College when it handles complaints from the public. An inquiry committee must determine if appropriate standards of practice have been met. And they were in this case. The judge avoided ruling on the legality of the physician overriding Sanders’ consent saying “this was not a clear situation in which a physician plainly acted illegally against the wishes of a representative acting in good faith in the patient’s interests.” Jennifer Cameron,a lawyer with the Victoria firm that is representing Thomas Sanders, said a decision on whether to appeal the decision will be made soon. “Our client remains concerned that his mother didn’t consent to the treatment provided to her and, despite the fact that she named her son as her representative, they unilaterally removed him as her representative.” Cameron said the matter of revocation of representative agreements remains fuzzy and the current decision doesn’t clarify when doctors can override such agreements. Sanders believed he was acting according to his mother’s wishes and in her best interests, she said. Love could not be reached for comment. pfayerman@postmedia.com Follow me on Twitter"
243,"Mar 14, 2018","Having good genes definitely help if you plan to live 85, 90 or 100-plus years — but they aren’t the only thing that matters. Canada’s longest-lived seniors tend to have parents who live at least nine years longer than average and that’s a lot, according to Angela Brooks-Wilson, who runs a 16-year healthy aging study at Simon Fraser University. But lifestyle always plays a bigger role in how long you live, she said. If you want to live to 85 and longer, it helps to stay busy. Study participant Ivan Vance — just 90 years old — hits the gym and the courts at the Jericho Tennis Club about four times a week and really pushes himself. After the gym, he hits serves for an hour or more. And it’s singles only for Vance, when he plays. “These guys in their 60s are playing doubles, I don’t even think they sweat,” said the former lumber trader turned actor. “Mostly they don’t want to play me anyway, it’s too hard on their ego.” “I get the best tennis from the top women; they are really good players,” he said. Vance calls it like he sees it, especially if he doesn’t like what he sees. “The secret is, I vent,” he said. “If I see something that pisses me off, I respond — hopefully always politely — with ‘I hear what you are saying, but I think you are wrong and here’s why.’ I dump my concerns off of me and on to you.” Seriously though, Vance has been active his whole life. “I have been skiing for 76 years and I have been playing tennis since I was 60,” he said. “Tennis is tough game and you’ve got to be in shape, so lifting weights for a few minutes isn’t going to cut it. I work at it.” It is always challenging to schedule the interviews with “super seniors” study participants because of their busy schedules, said Brooks-Wilson. “They are very socially active and lot of them exercise — about 50 per cent — as many as the middle-aged comparison group,” she said. “Super seniors are definitely not couch potatoes.” The late band leader Dal Richards and nonagenarian track star Olga Kotelko were also part of her super group. Seniors in the study must be free of cancer, dementia, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and major lung disease at the time they join. They range in age from 85 — the minimum — to 109 years of age. The researchers are examining candidate genes believed to be related to healthy aging, looking for differences between 700 super seniors and a comparison group of 500 randomly selected people in their 40s. That means they are young enough that any genetic predisposition to disease has not yet killed many of them. Not surprisingly, very few super seniors have the APOe4 gene that is strongly associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease. “What’s interesting is that some do have it … and yet they are still super, so it’s not a given that they will get Alzheimer’s,” said Brooks-Wilson, also a Distinguished Scientist with Canada’s Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre at the B.C. Cancer Agency. Super seniors are also less likely to have a gene variant related to inflammation, which is implicated in the five major diseases that super seniors don’t have by definition. While you can’t control your genome, there are powerful lifestyle choices you can make if you aim to live past 85. Smoking tobacco is an effective way to avoid getting very old, while quitting is almost as effective at extending your life. “We have almost no life-long smokers in the super seniors group, but about half have smoked and then quit at some time in the past,” she said. Super seniors — if they drink  alcohol — have three or four drinks a week and were much more moderate in their consumption than the comparison group. “Both moderate drinking and non-drinking are compatible with being a super senior,” she noted. Super seniors don’t tend to be “super-skinny,” she said. Many of them have a body mass index of about 25 — the upper end of the normal band, bordering on overweight. Brooks-Wilson will share her research in the SFU President’s Faculty lecture series on Thursday, March 15 at 5 p.m. at SFU’s Burnaby campus  in the Diamond Alumni Centre. She is also anxious to recruit new super seniors. Anyone aged 85 or older who is interested in participating may call 604-675-8151, or emailstudycoordinator@bcgsc.ca. rshore@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

244,"Mar 05, 2018","Fine-tuning zoning and setting aside a portion of social housing for seniors are among the ways an aging population may be accommodated in Metro Vancouver, according to an international report by theGrosvenor Group. Traditionally, the discussion among politicians, planners and the public has primarily focused on affordability for young people in the region, said James Patillo, one of the report’s authors. But, with a rapidly aging population, the elderly have to be taken into account as well, he said. “Let’s focus on the aging and the demographics of that,” said Patillo, managing director of development for Grosvenor Americas. “There is a large segment of the population that is getting larger that has to be addressed.” The report by the British developer is called Silver Cities. It looks at the global implications of an aging population and how that will play out in the real estate market in four cities: Hong Kong, London, Madrid and Vancouver. The report was released Monday. Grosvenor Group‘s regional operating company, Grosvenor Americas, has been based in Vancouver since 1953. As an example of flexible zoning in Metro Vancouver, Patillo cited changing single-family zoning to allow laneway houses as the City of Vancouver has done. Other zoning changes to add more housing diversity could include smaller lot sizes, as well as allowing duplexes, secondary suites and townhouses. By densifying single-family neighbourhoods, aging residents can continue living where they often want to stay. It can also be a multi-generational solution by providing cheaper housing alternatives for younger families. In more high-density neighbourhoods, he said, larger suites of three and four bedrooms can accommodate older consumers who are looking to downsize from bigger, single-family houses. One challenge for the public sector will be older people on fixed incomes who either don’t own or don’t have enough equity in their homes to downsize. “They’re going to need help and there are a variety of ways to look at that,” he said. Government intervention could include designating a certain number of units in social- and affordable-housing projects for seniors. In other projects, a developer might receive a density bonus, for example, by providing a certain number of units for older residents. Patillo suggested more may need to be done in future along the lines of the recent NDP budget that pledged to spend $6.6 billion over 10 years on groups not served by the market, such as women and children fleeing violence, students and seniors. Patillo acknowledged that because of the affordability crisis in Metro, the terms “density” and “densification” have become identified with developers. He made a point of saying, however, that what he’s talking about is overall density in a neighbourhood. “The industry has been pushing for more supply for a long time,” he said. “In a constrained market, more supply is going to hopefully create better affordability because there are more options. Attitudes are starting to change. It’s still a challenge.” Brian Biggs, senior analyst, Group Research, said if aging consumers aren’t downsizing in the numbers expected that may be because there aren’t the housing options to entice them out of their homes. The report includes the provocative statement that “the elderly cannot live at the same high density as the young.” It goes on to refer to developers who build “ever-smaller-sized apartments” geared to young workers. “We can maybe be more innovative about how we do density,” said Biggs, part of the report’s research team. “Density as it is done now tends to be in highrise buildings. It’s not necessarily amendable to creating communities. What we’re trying to generate is a kind of density that works for everybody.” Biggs said an example of “quality, age-friendly housing” is housing that takes into account mobility issues that people can develop as they age. “Efforts to achieve greater density will be better if focused on building medium-density to make downsizing more attractive to the elderly,” the report says. The report describes the aging population as ‘silver consumers,’ although it cautions there is great variability within that group. “The swelling number of retirees, combined with strong income and wealth levels, means the elderly consumer market is set to grow rapidly over the next 30 years,” the report says. Biggs said by phone from San Francisco that the coming wave of retirees “will be one of the largest and wealthiest cohorts of retirees in history.” Silver consumers, according to the report, tend to be less price sensitive, make more frequent small trips to shop, are more willing to spend on luxury items, and tend to shop during weekends and working hours. Theorigins of Grosvenor’s property businessdate to 1677 when land west of the City of London came into the family.

245,"Feb 28, 2018","The social model of Canada’s first ‘dementia village’ is a good one that needs to part of a continuum to give people choices in where they choose to live, according to the B.C.seniors advocate. Isobel Mackenziesaid Wednesday that because the number of people with dementia will grow as the population ages, the need for facilities such asThe Villagein Langley will also increase. Mackenzie cautioned that most people who live to 85 years of age and older will be living in their own home and maintain all their cognitive abilities. “(But) we need to remember that there are those who won’t,” she said. “It is those people that I think are most deserving of our attention and our resources. I think that (The Village) will go a long way to bringing continued dignified living to those who deserve it.” The Villagein Langley is described as the country’s first community designed specifically for people with dementia. It based on the Dutch model ofHogeweykwhich is designed so residents on their own can safely walk the streets, squares and gardens and use the theatre and grocery store. Following groundbreaking for the project, Mackenzie spoke at an information session in the Township of Langley City Hall. Once completed next spring, The Village will be a community of up to 78 people with dementia and other cognitive and physical impairments living in six, single story cottages. Care will be provided by 72 staff. The Village is at 3920 198th St which is known as the Old Bradshaw Elementary School site. The Village is entirely funded by the private sector. Although the final costs haven’t been set, it is estimated that each person will pay $190 to $245 a day or between $6,000 to $7,500 a month for care. Speaking to the media after the information session, Mackenzie acknowledged that The Village works for people who have the money to pay. “The question is: How do people without those means find care?” she said. “This is one model and it is good model but there needs to be other models because different people have different abilities and will want to make different choices.” Mackenzie said because of the greatly appreciated value of homes in Metro Vancouver and to some extent in Victoria, aging homeowners are finding that they’re able to afford a level of care they didn’t anticipate when they retired. “I think there are opportunities for the government to look at how it might want to help people subsidize their residential care in a different way to facilitate greater choice,” she said. She gave the following example: If the government is already subsidizing someone at a cost of $4,300 based on income in a facility, then maybe the individual is given that amount to use it wherever she or he wants. In some cases, family members may be able to add another $3,000. “I think we need to look at that,” she said. “That will to some extent address this ghettoization. Then people really are choosing where they want to spend the last two and-a-half years or three years of their life.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
246,,"Canada’s first community designed specifically for people with dementia is opening next year in Langley. It’s calledThe Village. Comprised of six, single-storey cottage-style homes and a community centre, The Village will be home to 78 people with dementia, an umbrella term that includes people suffering from Alzheimer’s and other degenerative brain diseases associated with aging. Care will be provided by 72 specially trained staff. Project leaderElroy Jespersensaid The Village’s design was inspired byHogeweyk, the world’s first dementia village, in The Netherlands. Jespersen, the vice-president of special projects for Verve Senior Living, said The Village builds on the other assisted- and extended-care communities he has developed during the past 29 years. “We’ve really designed and tried to build communities where people could be independent and live their own life their way,” Jespersen said. “And by and large we were able to do that — with the one exception when somebody developed dementia and they could no longer live safely in our communities. We thought we should add another piece to that to allow them to stay within, if you will, our ‘family’ of communities.” The Village is at 3920 198th St., which is known as the Old Bradshaw Elementary School site. Groundbreaking is Wednesday, and Jesperson said he expects The Village to be finished by April 2019. “What makes The Village different from traditional nursing homes … is that residents will be able to shop, have a coffee, walk their dog, get their hair cut and take part in activities such as gardening by themselves,” Jespersen said. Three of the cottages will be designed to allow a couple to live together, and the other three will have an extra guest room for short-term stays for people with dementia. Living in the privately funded project won’t be cheap. Jespersen said he is still working on final numbers, but he estimates it will cost between $190 to $245 a day per person, or $6,000 to $7,500 a month. “People will say that’s a lot of money, and it absolutely is a lot of money,” he said. “It’s about the same amount of money we would get from the government if the government funded us to provide care. That’s what it costs to do what we’re doing.” Jespersen said The Village would be open to working with government to make it more affordable to people so that there is a real community of people of different income levels. The world’s first “dementia village” isHogeweykoutside of Amsterdam, where 152 people live in 23 houses on 3.7 acres. Residents can walk the streets, squares and gardens and go to a theatre and grocery store. In Hogeweyk, the buildings are designed so they create a border that allows residents to wander safely within the property. Access is controlled by a single entry and exit. The Village will have a similar design, but in a rural setting on five acres. The site will be surrounded by an eight-foot perimeter fence designed to blend in with its surroundings. Jespersen said The Village has been designed to give people “unfettered access to the outside.” All the residences are at ground level so no one has to negotiate steps to enter their home. No locks on doors also allows residents freedom to move. “Everyone comes in through one door in the community centre … and they leave that way,” he said. “Once you’re beyond that, people can move about, sit on the benches, and go wherever the path leads.” The Village includes a barn that could be home to chickens and other farm animals, but that will be up to the residents to decide, Jespersen said. “If we’re going to give more than lip-service to person-directed living, we can’t say we’re going to do this, this and this. Until we have people living there, we don’t know what we’re going to do,” he said. “We do know that most people have pets in their lives. If you have a pet, they’re welcome to come to The Village with you. If you don’t, we can arrange to have pets. I hope there will be a bit of a menagerie.” In Metro Vancouver, another dementia village is being planned by Providence Health Care on the St. Vincent’s Hospital site at Heather Street and West 33rd. Not expected to open for several years, the village would be home to more than 300 people with dementia. Providence Health Care operates several health facilities, including St. Paul’s Hospital and Mount Saint Joseph Hospital. kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
247,"Feb 24, 2018","So what difference would 22 minutes of extra care really make in the day of a senior living in one of B.C.’s care homes? It might mean showering more than once a week. Or going to the toilet when they want. Or receiving more help at mealtimes. It would mean regaining some dignity, advocates say. “The difficulty is if you cannot choose how your day goes. It’s bad enough to lose your dignity when people have to help you toilet and bathe, but if you have no control over when you eat or when you go to bed, these are not happy situations,” said Gudrun Langolf, president of the Council of Senior Citizens’ Organizations of B.C. “These are the most vulnerable of our citizens. Those are the people who cannot take care of themselves, and I’m glad that the (recent) budget started there.” The NDP’s first budget, released Tuesday, made headlines for its pledges to improve childcare and affordable housing in B.C. But the document also earmarked some money to help seniors, ranging from expanding a rental assistance program to cutting ferry fees. The most significant investment to help B.C.’s aging population, though, was $548 million to improve seniors residential care, which includes home and community care, as well as assisted living. A significant portion of that money will be aimed at increasing the number of care hours residents in seniors’ homes receive each day. Seniors in these homes currently receive an average of 3.14 hours of direct care per day. B.C.’s Seniors’ Advocate Isobel Mackenzie and others have long argued this should be increased to a minimum of 3.36 hours a day, or an average increase of 22 minutes. Only 15 per cent of B.C.’s nearly 300 residential facilities are meeting this target. Improving those care hours will not revolutionize residential care, Mackenzie said, but will offer some much-needed improvement. “It’s still never going to be perfect,” she said, but noted it will be better than it is today. “Who out there wants to have a bath or shower only once a week?” It will cost $110 million annually to increase staff so that all homes can offer an average of 3.36 care hours per resident, but this won’t happen all at once — change is expected to be phased in over the next three years. It will essentially be a reversal of the slashing of government funding that “put us in this glue” in the first place, Mackenzie said. “That’s how we got here. We cut a little, cut a little, cut a little. We thought, ‘Ah, what is five minutes a day to an individual?'” she said. Arecent reportby Mackenzie’s office analyzes 293 residential care homes with 27,142 publicly subsidized beds in B.C. One third are run directly by health authorities, and tend to have more complex clients. The remainder are run by private contractors, but with funding from health authorities. Only four per cent of private operators, who negotiate their contracts with the health authorities, meet the goal of 3.36 direct care hours, while one third of the health authority-run facilities meet the target. Mackenzie anticipates the focus of new funding over the first two years will be to improve the service provided by the homes with the lowest care hours per resident. Daniel Fontaine, CEO of the B.C. Care Providers Association, which represents these private contractors, said reaching the 3.36-hours benchmark is “absolutely critical” so that his members can not only provide quality care, but also improve seniors’ quality of life. “For these seniors, the quality of life is also important. … When you don’t have enough staff, those are the things that are cut back,” he said. “It absolutely has a huge impact, both to the staff but to the seniors as well.” But he said the “vast majority” of contractors are not given funding from the health authorities to offer the targeted number of care hours. Right now, private contractors provide on average only 3.01 direct care hours per resident, according to Mackenzie’s research. “Now with this new funding, we are hopeful that many more will get close to the 3.36. But remember, the commitment on the part of the province is only to bring it up to an average of 3.36,” he said. “We have advocated that it be a minimum per site of 3.36.” Earlier this month, health authorities told the private contractors to start moving staff from part-time to full-time positions, and asked how many new people they will need to hire to reach the target, Fontaine said. “The bigger alarm bell we’ve been raising for the provincial government is where are all these people going to come from to work in these positions? We have significant concern,” Fontaine said. “Seniors care is the fastest-growing sector in the province, in terms of job growth, and we need to get people really excited and interested in working in the sector.” He likens the situation to school boards in B.C. that were mandated after a court ruling to hire thousands of new teachers, but many have struggled to find enough recruits. Health Minister Adrian Dix estimates roughly 1,500 new jobs will need to be filled, including 900 care aides and 465 nurses. He said government has been working with Fontaine’s association, as well as post-secondary institutions and various health-care unions, on how to ramp up training and recruitment. Dix agreed that another challenge is to resolve the much lower funding contracts that health authorities have traditionally provided to private contractors to run their seniors’ homes. This is a throw-back to an old system when the private contractors had few complex patients, but with an aging population, an increasing number of seniors require higher levels of care. “If we are going to make 3.36 — and when 67 per cent of the beds are private … and those beds have a lower average — then clearly very significant portions of the funds have to go there to raise those up,” Dix said. “But we have some work to do on the health authority-owned and -operated ones as well.” Mackenzie is concerned, though, that B.C. doesn’t have an audit system to track whether the money is being spent specifically on increasing care hours. For example, when care aides call in sick or go on vacation, she wants to know that they will be replaced. Or if there is a staff opening, she wants to know that the money for that person’s salary will not be re-directed to other spending while a replacement is sought. “You don’t want to have incentives to operators to leave positions unfilled,” she said. “We need to do a better job of making sure that the money is being spent on the items that we have funded that facility to spend the money on.” Dix said this is a high priority for his government and that the money will be properly tracked. “We’re in a position to do that, working with public and private providers, because we’ve come to the table with credibility here. We’ve said this is a major issue, one of the most significant issues facing B.C.,” he said. The previous Liberal government acknowledged the care home problem with a $500-million announcement last year, but $276 million of it was federal dollars intended only for home care, not residential care, Dix said. When the NDP formed government last summer, it forged ahead with about $20 million set aside by the Liberals to start improving care hours, and have now added the additional money in this budget, he added. “A lot of what we do in seniors care is about safety,” Dix said. “But I do think we have to make sure in long-term care, that we are also focused on quality of life. This is not just a matter of preventing death, or a place for people to go at the end of life, but that, wherever they are, they are living life to the fullest.” Langolf, who has toured seniors facilities as president of the umbrella organization that represents many seniors groups in the province, welcomes the move to 3.36 care hours, but argues it is still bare bones. Last year, she noted, Ontario pledged to increase direct care hours in seniors’ homesto four hours per dayper resident. And she said waiting until 2021 for all the homes in B.C. to get up to that “low standard” is unfair to suffering seniors. “Three years is too long. We’ve been waiting 16 years or longer. But, I’m still saying this is a good start,” she said. “They are trying very hard to fulfill some of their promises. We applaud that. Would we like to see more? Of course.” lculbert@postmedia.com Twitter:@loriculbert NDP budget promises to help seniors Source: Budget 2018"
248,"Feb 20, 2018","The College of Registered Nurses of B.C. says a precedent-setting penalty to a nurse who financially exploited an elderly couple should serve as a deterrent to others thinking about enriching themselves at the expense of patients in their care. Former nurse Laurie Tinkham, of Nanaimo, is the first B.C. nurse ever to be fined by the college for professional misconduct. In itsdecision,the college said Tinkham can’t apply to have her licence reinstated for at least five years. Her fine totalled $17,500 — half the maximum fine under bylaws — after a three-year investigation and hearing process concluded she breached numerous ethical and professional standards while caring for a now-deceased elderly couple. She was also ordered to pay investigation costs to the college of $16,536. The nurse’s misdeeds include being the couple’s power of attorney and putting her name on the title of a $30,000 mobile home (which she still owns according to B.C. Assessment Authority records) that was bought by the couple. As well, the couple paid for her dentistry, vision care and $1,600/month in medications. All of this was on top of a monthly stipend for her services which was kept to a certain threshold ($800) a month so that it would not jeopardize her taxpayer-funded long-term disability payments of $900 a month. According to the college: “Her failing to maintain appropriate boundaries involved her reaping substantial financial benefits from an infirm client, and her also gaining access to assets through a power of attorney. Such conduct stands to significantly erode the public’s confidence in nurses, whom the public trusts to care for vulnerable clients. Ms. Tinkham’s conduct engages a need for measures that will deter similar conduct by other registrants, and promote public confidence in the profession and its ability to self-regulate.” Cynthia Johansen, CEO of the College of Registered Nurses of B.C., said in the past few years complaints about nursing interactions with the elderly have increased but she couldn’t provide numbers or information about the specific complaints. The college is exploring how to dig deeper into the trends and, in the meantime, is posting more case studies on its website to make sure nurses are aware of their ethical and professional responsibilities and boundary violations. The college’s decision comes at a time when numerous agencies are reporting increases in cases of financial abuse of elders. The Seniors Abuse and Information Line, operated by a non-profit organization calledSeniors First B.C.,reports that in 2014, 25.6 per cent of calls pertained to financial abuse; in 2015, the proportion rose to 28.9 per cent and in 2016, the last year for which such information is available, the proportion rose to 30.4 per cent. The Vancouver Police Department tracks reports of physical and financial abuse of elders. Cases of financial abuse have risen from 119 in 2009 to 202 in 2016. In most of the police cases, however, the suspect was neither a family member nor caregiver. Complaints related to seniors are also fielded by a211 Helpline, primarily funded by the United Way. Elder abuse (not just financial) accounts for 37 per cent of all calls. A survey commissioned by Vancity Credit Union indicates that about 40 per cent of seniors in Vancouver and Victoria say they have been victims of financial abuse. Isobel Mackenzie, Seniors Advocate of B.C., said she is “more familiar than I want to be” with the issue of financial exploitation of elders. “Overwhelmingly, most relationships (between health professionals and older clients or patients) are fine, but from my own experience, I have seen everything, from care aides taking a few dollars out of a client’s wallet to those who’ve gone to the bank with clients, to withdraw bigger amounts. I can’t deny it happens, I’ve been in meetings with investigators hearing about these things, but when one thinks about the number of clients and visits, it’s thankfully still a small percentage.” Mackenzie said the Tinkham case will naturally give rise to worries on the part of families hiring home care workers. “One challenge is context and perspective. We don’t want to create unnecessary fear and suspicion while drawing attention to this to create more awareness. We don’t want seniors to think everyone is going to rob them,” she said. While the college website can be checked to find out about the licenses of registered nurses, the database for theB.C. Care Aide and Community Health Worker Registrycan also be consulted – but only by employers, not the public – to learn if workers are credentialed and if they have been suspended or removed after being terminated for client abuse, defined as financial, emotional, physical, sexual, or neglect. Mackenzie said she worries that with population aging and health care worker staff shortages, people may be “tempted to lower the bar” when it comes to who they hire or not being sufficiently circumspect about home care providers. “Some are reticent to report anything, others don’t want to make waves. People want to give others the benefit of the doubt.” In the Tinkham case, the former nurse admitted that the elderly male had a case of “romantic transference” which could have marred his judgment. The Vancouver Island Health Authority was involved in the care of the couple and an outreach worker was first to spot and report the unusual arrangement between Tinkham and the couple. Mackenzie said individuals can usethe Patient Care Quality Officesfor each health authority to file complaints about abuse or neglect. More frail and vulnerable people are living longer in their homes so Mackenzie expects that may be fuelling the increase in reports of elder abuse. “The potential for financial abuse is significantly greater in home care. That is one of the biggest fears of seniors and their families,” she said. pfayerman@postmedia.com Chronicle of the Laurie Tinkham Case: 2001: Tinkham first registered with CRNBC, but her license lapsed in 2003. 2010: Tinkham renewed her licence, called herself a self-employed nurse and gave her address as the home of the couple she financially exploited. She had initially been placed there while working for a private agency, Nurse Next Door. At some point, Tinkham severed her contract with the company and established a direct arrangement with the unidentified couple. She could not be reached for comment. Nurse Next Door in Nanaimo did not respond to requests for an interview. 2012: While providing care to the elderly couple in Nanaimo, Tinkham obtained enduring power of attorney over the clients’ affairs. She purchased a mobile home with them and title passed to her when the couple died. She received over $11,000 in payments from the male client’s bank account over a two or three-month period, in addition to her salary. The sum was for her personal benefit, the college found. 2013: A seniors outreach worker with Vancouver Island Health Authority filed a complaint against Tinkham to the college after doing a home visit and observing irregularities in the nurse-client relationship. According to the college, Tinkham admitted she had a “very unusual arrangement” with the couple. The college began a three-year investigation. Tinkham’s RN licence lapsed and never renewed. During the investigation, Tinkham said she was merely providing personal, not nursing care, to the couple. But the college found that helping them with daily bowel functions and dressings for wound care is indeed part of nursing care. The male client died in 2013 and his wife months later. The circumstances or causes of their deaths is unknown. In 2014, full title of the mobile home was transferred to Tinkham. 2017: In February, a hearing against Tinkham held at the college. 2018: The 2017 college decision is released to the public, only after the appeal period has ended."
249,"Dec 17, 2017","Skyrocketing rents and dwindling affordable-housing units in Vancouver are driving seniors to the brink of homelessness, forcing some to couch surf, seek roommates or even live in cars, advocates say. While the debate over the city’s housing crisis often focuses on millennials, people who work with seniors say elderly adults have lower incomes and fewer supports to withstand being displaced from their homes. “People end up living on the streets, or living in their cars, or crashing with friends, sleeping on the couch,” said Linda Forsythe, a board member of 411 Seniors Centre Society. “That used to happen a lot with young people,” she said. “They could tolerate it quite well, and sort of get on with their lives, whereas, with older people, you don’t have a chance to make more money. That’s the problem.” Seniors are enduring the same rent hikes as other tenants in Vancouver, but have disproportionately lower incomes and higher medical costs. A provincial grant to help elderly renters has not kept pace, and subsidized units have decreased, experts say. Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters, or SAFER, is a provincial subsidy applied to rent up to a certain cap. The rent cap in the Lower Mainland is $765 a month, even though the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,223, according to the Canada Mortgage Housing Corporation. That means a senior who pays $765 a month rent and earns less than $27,000 a year can receive a subsidy of about $200 a month. But someone paying $1,500 a month in rent would receive the same amount. Outside the Lower Mainland, such as in Victoria or Kelowna, the rent cap drops to $667. Over the past decade, average rents have risen 45 per cent but the cap has only gone up by nine per cent, said Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s seniors’ advocate. “The compounding effect presents the stark reality we have today, which is the huge gap between the SAFER cap of $765 in the Lower Mainland and the rent most people are paying,” she said. Mackenzie called on the province to increase the cap to parallel average rents and adjust it annually. Elderly homeowners also face challenges. Mackenzie said she has asked the province to allow seniors to not only defer their property taxes but also other expenses, such as strata fees or utility costs, and to set up a borrowing fund for major repairs. The number of seniors’ subsidized housing units have decreased nearly five per cent since 2013, while waiting lists have grown, she said. Seniors are ending up in residential care before they need to because they can’t afford their rent, Mackenzie added. The B.C. government said in a statement that addressing the housing crisis is its top priority and it is working on a long-term, comprehensive plan it will roll out in its February budget. It has set a target of building 114,000 affordable-housing units throughout the province, it said, and currently there are more than 2,400 units of affordable rental housing for seniors under construction or in development. Anthony Kupferschmidt, executive director of the West End Seniors’ Network, said high rents are forcing seniors to make grim choices. “They’re having to choose between whether or not they pay their rent this month or they buy groceries, or they keep their power on, or they pay for the medications they need,” he said. In response to more seniors asking for help finding a roommate, Kupferschmidt’s group is exploring setting up a program to help pair up older adults. It could involve a database of names or social events where people can get to know potential roommates, he said. Immigrant seniors face additional challenges, said Queenie Choo, CEO of S.U.C.C.E.S.S., a multi-service agency that assists newcomers as well as older Canadians. Language barriers and waiting times are key issues, and immigrants sponsored by family aren’t eligible for SAFER, she said. “They want to be independent and they are unable to access some of these benefits,” she said. Even outside of Vancouver, seniors are struggling. Lola-Dawn Fennell, executive director of the Prince George Council of Seniors, recently told a House of Commons committee that most clients come to the centre in crisis. “When you are already stretched to your monthly income and emotional and physical limits, a broken-down furnace or a bill collection notice or one more hour of caregiving can become a last straw,” she said. “Yes, we see suicidal seniors.” CLICK HEREto report a typo.

250,"Dec 15, 2017","84 CANDLES: Japanese Canadians and others filled the Bayshore hotel’s ballroom recently at a birthday party for Emperor Akihito, who will be 84 on Dec. 23. It was a bittersweet celebration because of the previous day’s official acceptance of his request to abdicate on April 30 in favour of Crown Prince Naruhito. So said Consul General Asako Okai, while acknowledging Akihito’s “unchanging devotion” to duty. Noting the 150th anniversary of Canadian confederation, Okai reminded guests that 2018 will mark 150 years since the revolutionary Meiji Restoration sparked Japan’s “cultural transformation and rapid emergence on the global stage.” As well as “increasing bilateral engagement” with B.C. and the “historic advance” of the 11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership’s core elements, Canadian visitors to Japan increased by 18 per cent between 2015 and 2016, Oka said. RICE AND EASY: Raising a sake glass at the Bayshore event, Masa Shiroki remembered a 2009 event when visiting Emperor Akihito did the same with his made-in-Vancouver sake. Shiroki’s Artisan Sakemaker at Granville Island firm uses ginpu sake rice he grows on leased Abbotsford and Surrey farmland. He raises nanatsuboshi table rice, too, and urges others to do so. “If you have partial farmland that has drainage issue, that is exactly what rice needs, “ he said. Let’s drink to that. WHOLLY MOSES: In his mid-twenties and with more hair than a barbershop floor, CBC wunderkind Moses Znaimer regaled a beatnik hangout’s listeners on his formula to brighten television’s radiant future. Yeah-yeah, one thought. Still, Tajikistan-born Znaimer did accomplish most of those youthful predictions. Prophetic again in 2005, he recognized that his silver-haired contemporaries constituted an untapped marketing gold mine. Znaimer promptly nicknamed them Zoomers, founded The Canadian Association for Retired Persons, now CARP, and added magazine and TV media to profitably address them. Motivated by the Latin aphorism carpe diem, meaning “seize the day,” he modified it to CARPe Diem as the title of a 39-episode, half-hour TV show he’ll launch in early 2018. It will be produced and hosted by Vancouver-based associate Carmen Ruiz y Laza, who is familiar to Znaimer’s Joytv viewers and those attending related events. PAGE TURNED: Earlier-era television flickered back to life when the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame opened its exhibition on CKVU-TV and later CHEK-TV’s career-building 1997-to-2005 Sport Page show. Founding anchors Richard Saxton and Rob Glazier — but not John Good — traded memories with former colleagues and other jocks. Saxton left in 1982 for sports, business and automotive TV roles in California, and Glazier for play-by-play duties with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. FOR REAL: Actors and advertisement models often play husband and wife, but fashion models Cata Simian and Elza Sasaki are the real thing.

That’s the mantra for Liquor, Lust, And The Law author Aaron Chapman and publisher Arsenal Pulp Press. Subtitled “The story of Vancouver’s legendary Penthouse nightclub,” the 2012 book became a Canadian best-seller, thus ensuring a revised edition containing more photos of the Seymour Street joint’s celebrity and guys-and-dolls clientele. There are even recipes from club co-founder and principal Joe Philliponi’s mother Maria, including Fratello fritters, Ciambella alle Acciughe (anchovy buns) and her ever-bracing Pasta with Vodka and Spicy Tomato Cream Sauce. Invitations for the revised work’s recent launch party were discreetly headed: Books! Booze! Burlesque. With the neighbouring Seymour Billiards hall and Iaci’s restaurant long gone, the Penthouse’s days must be as numbered as were those of Philliponi. He was murdered in an adjacent frame house-office in 1979 with mother Maria hearing the gunshots. BUTTONED UP: Women seeking husbands — even someone else’s — once booked Sunday-evening first-class flights to major business centres. Marriage wasn’t on psychologist Allison Connolly’s mind during a 2013 London-Vancouver journey when Jesse Zubot occupied the adjacent economy-class seat. He’s a virtuosic violinist who accompanies and produces albums for Nunavut throat singer Tanya Tagaq. “I had no intention of talking to him,” Connolly recalled. “But he kept putting his elbow on my volume button.” Four years later, she figuratively left her seat to walk the aisle with him.

251,"Dec 14, 2017","Violent offences against seniors have decreased 14 per cent while property offences against British Columbians aged 65 and older have increased 36 per cent during the past nine years, according to a report by the B.C. seniors advocate. The thirdMonitoring Seniors’ Services report, released Thursday, includes data compiled by the RCMP that shows violent offences dropped from 1,131 in 2009 to 972 last year. During the same period, property offences increased from 11,835 to 16,106. Isobel Mackenzie, the province’s seniors’ advocate, said she does not know the reason for either the decrease in violent offences or the increase in property offences against seniors. “One of the challenges with any police data is whether incidents are increasing, or reporting is increasing,” Mackenzie said in a media teleconference. “We’re not sure what’s happening.” Violence offences include any offences that result in harm to an individual; property offences include theft of personal items and damage to homes. She said this was the first time her office has included this kind of data in its annual report. The seniors advocate will now be able to track this information over time in future reports. “Seniors are going to be more susceptible to this simply because they own single-family homes and have property worth stealing,” Mackenzie said. Other areas of concern singled out by Mackenzie include the decrease in home support services and adult day programs and the increase in lack of affordability for seniors who rent. Mackenzie said the report becomes more meaningful each iteration because she is able to see trends develop over time. The report notes that as of the end of March this year, there were 1,245 seniors waiting to access adult day programs. (Adult day programs are described as programs where seniors are brought together as a group outside of the home — programs that also give caregivers a break.) The median wait time for seniors ranged between 38 and 195 days. The number of funded adult day program days offered has decreased eight per cent since 2015-16. “The average home support hours delivered per client per year decreased by (three per cent) from the previous year, while the number of clients increased by 3.5 per cent,” the report says. “This trend of decreases in home support matched against increased client complexity continues to be of concern.” Mackenzie said that the provincial government should be concerned by the lack of support in these areas because it will mean more seniors in residential care, which is more costly to the taxpayer. “We know there are up to 15 per cent of seniors living in residential care who could live in the community with proper supports,” she said in a news release. Mackenzie said she remains “very concerned” about the situation facing the 19 per cent of seniors who rent their homes. Since 2005, the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) maximum rent that qualifies for a subsidy has increased nine per cent, while rents have increased 45 per cent — including seven per cent last year. “We see rent increases far in excess of inflation, and no increase on the rent cap on SAFER program,” she said. Other highlights include: • In 2016, 655,000, or 76 per cent, of all seniors maintained an active driver’s licence, a 4.5-per-cent increase since 2015. During this same period, the population aged 65 and older increased four per cent. • Last year, of 65,81 driver fitness cases opened for seniors aged 80 and older, only 950 (fewer than two per cent) were referred for a DriveAble cognitive assessment. • The Seniors Supplement, a monthly top-up provided by the province, is $49.30. It hasn’t had a rate increase since 1987. kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
252,"Nov 24, 2017","By 2030, one in four of us will be over 65. Today about 16 per cent of Canadians are over 65, and seniors already use about half of the health care budget. Those numbers are not sustainable. The main reason for the disproportionate use of the health care system by seniors is frailty. Can anything be done to change that? Frailty is not a natural consequence of aging. Frailty is the intersection of age-related decline with chronic diseases and conditions. Most importantly it is associated with many poor outcomes like falls, cognitive impairment, hospitalization, admission to long term care and death. It’s complicated, but what is encouraging is that we are learning more about how and when it happens, and how to prevent it. Researchers in Canada are considered world leaders in frailty and none is better known that Dr. Kenneth Rockwood from Dalhousie University. He is the inventor of multiple health care tools to diagnose frailty, which are used around the world. We asked Dr. Rockwood to join us for a Conversation That Matters about changing what we know about frailty and how we treat it.

253,"Nov 14, 2017","TORONTO — Like many Canadians, Anne Van Burek had chickenpox as a child. But she never expected the virus that causes the itchy rash to come back to haunt her decades later. In February, Van Burek developed shingles, a highly painful skin rash caused by the varicella-zoster virus that can become reactivated as people age and the strength of their immune systems begin to wane. The rash started with a couple of blisters on her right hand, then spread up her arm to her shoulder. “The pain was indescribable,” Van Burek said Tuesday. “I couldn’t unscrew the toothpaste tube. “I was completely disabled. February, March were a black hole, April a black hole. I started to be able to get dressed and go out for short walks in May,” said the French teacher at a private Toronto girls’ school, who wasn’t able to return to class for the rest of the school year. Van Burek, who’s in her 60s, had developed postherpetic neuralgia — an often excruciating complication of shingles that affects 10 to 30 per cent of those who get shingles, with incidence increasing with age. But the onslaught of shingles can be prevented with vaccination, doctors say. A shingles vaccine called Zostovax currently available in Canada decreases cases by about 50 per cent in those previously infected with chickenpox, and reduces the risk of postherpetic neuralgia by about 67 per cent. “But the thing about that vaccine, though, is the older you are, the less likely you are to respond to it,” said Dr. Mark Loeb, an infectious diseases specialist at McMaster University in Hamilton. “So people over the age of 80, only about a quarter of them were protected from postherpetic neuralgia.” However, a new vaccine called Shingrix, approved by Health Canada last month and available in January, has been shown in clinical trials to be more than 90 per cent effective at preventing the nerve pain of shingles in people over age 50, when compared with a placebo. “The new vaccine is something we didn’t think was possible,” concedes Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, referring to how the product was made and its ability to stimulate the immune system. Unlike its forerunner manufactured by Merck, Shingrix by GlaxoSmithKline is not made with live attenuated zoster virus, but was created from a protein taken from an inactivated form of the virus, which triggers an immune response in the body, boosted by what’s called an adjuvant. “This vaccine appears to work more than 90 per cent of the time, which is really amazing,” said McGeer. Dr. Susie Barnes, vice-president and country medical director at GSK Canada, said the new vaccine is indicated for adults aged 50 and older and requires two doses given by injection in the arm, two to six months apart. As with most inoculations, there are potential side-effects, she acknowledged. “The most common ones we see are the local reactions, so pain, redness and swelling at the site of the injection. “And also, people can experience things like headache, muscle ache, fever,” Barnes said, describing these symptoms as typically mild and lasting about three days. “At the same time, if there’s something that lasts longer or is more severe than expected, we always make sure that people speak to their health-care professional.” Barnes wasn’t able to say how much Shingrix will cost Canadians, but noted that it would be no more than 30 per cent higher than the cost of Zostovax, which carries a price tag between $170 and $200 for two doses. That cost would have to be paid out of pocket by consumers or by private drug insurers; Ontario is the only jurisdiction in Canada to cover the cost of Zostovax for residents 65 to 70, she said, and it’s unclear if the province or others will decide to pick up the bill for Shingrix once it comes on the market next year. Still, inoculation against shingles is recommended for Canadians aged 60 and older by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), although that advice applies only to the currently available product. Those 50 to 59 may also consider getting the shot, NACI says. McGeer said shingles can be “enormously debilitating,” adding that it makes sense for people to get vaccinated, given that about 30 per cent of people who have had chickenpox will develop shingles at some point in their lifetime. “So it’s definitely a disease worth preventing,” she said. Loeb of McMaster said there are about 130,000 cases of shingles each year in Canada, leading to more than 250,000 doctors visits, with about 2,000 requiring hospitalization. About 17,000 of those afflicted by shingles go on to develop postherpetic neuralgia, which Loeb said can last weeks to months — and in some cases, years. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended Shingrix as the preferred vaccine for preventing shingles in adults age 50 and up, based on a close vote by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. “This is a high-efficacy vaccine,” said Loeb, adding that the research evidence supports its use. “It seems like it’s a bit of a no-brainer.” – Follow @SherylUbelacker on Twitter."
254,"Oct 18, 2017","A new report commissioned by the union representing HandyDart workers recommends that TransLink bring the service for people with disabilities in house instead of continuing to contract it out. Transportation planning consultant Eric Doherty will appear at a Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation meeting on Thursday morning to presenthis findings. “The evidence points to operating HandyDart directly as a public service as the best way to provide safe and quality service,” Doherty’s report states. “Contracting out to any of the large corporations that provide management services to transit agencies will likely compromise quality of service without any real cost saving.” The door-to-door shared ride service for people with physical and cognitive disabilities is currently provided by MVT Canadian Bus Inc. The document updates Doherty’s findings from a 2013 report saying an alarming number of people were being denied HandyDart trips. He said he was asked by the union to look at the present situation and what commitments have been made by the province and TransLink regarding HandyDart andgovernance. “The core things that the provincial government has committed to is to restore accountable governance at TransLink, and to increase HandyDart bus service by five per cent per year in every year for the next four years,” Doherty said in an interview. Doherty said those commitments could greatly improve the service, which is important considering the number of people over the age of 70 is projected to jump by 53 per cent in the next decade and increase demand for HandyDart service. “There are a lot of negative consequences if we fail to meet that demand,” Doherty said. “It’s pretty much essential that we look at these issues.” Doherty’s report states that HandyDart service per capita has declined over the past decade, while conventional transit has become more crowded and more difficult  to access for those with disabilities. Taxi trips have also increased. The decline in service is blamed on a freeze in service hours attributed to the actions of the then-Liberal government and appointed TransLink board of directors. Last year, TransLink conducted areview of the HandyDart serviceafter receiving numerous complaints about responsiveness to concerns, the standards and quality of HandyDart and taxi services, and the HandyDart service model and operations. The review resulted in a series of recommendations aimed at improving the service. Those recommendations, which were made by an advisory committee, were unanimously approved by the board of directors in March and implementation is underway. Doherty said the review did not go far enough in examining the quality and safety issues with contracting out HandyDart, and he disagreed with the conclusion that the service would not be brought in house. “It really does seem to be the thing that would deal with a lot of the quality problems or at least make it so there is a direct chain of responsibility to solving the problem,” Doherty said. “That’s a conclusion that some of the other transit agencies and governments have come to when they’ve dealt with numerous problems from their contractors over time — if you want it done right you have to take the reins and do it directly.” A public sector comparator was done, and it concluded that contractors could provide the service cheaper. Doherty said a broader multiple account evaluation should have been done. TransLink CEO Kevin Desmond said when he was first hired about 18 months ago, it was clear TransLink needed to do a better job with HandyDart. “It’s our responsibility at TransLink and CMBC as the owner of the service … whoever the operator is, whether it’s our own employees at CMBC or a contracted employee at HandyDart or Canada Line, that we hold them accountable to performance standards and performance outcomes,” he said. “I don’t know that we were doing that well enough on HandyDart when I got here. We are doing it better now.” Desmond said the focus now is on increasing service, which TransLink has already started doing. TransLink’s contract with MVT expires next year and the transit authority has already issued arequest for informationfor custom transit services call centre and passenger trip delivery. During the process, TransLink has worked with its stakeholders to identify key performance measures for whoever is awarded the contract. A final decision on the contractor or contractors will be made by the end of the year. jensaltman@postmedia.com twitter.com/jensaltman CLICK HEREto report a typo. Is there more to this story?

255,"Oct 15, 2017","NEW YORK — In a classroom, an old man glides in pushing a walker, and none of the young faces turn. In the cafeteria, a white-haired woman eats across from a teenager, to no one’s surprise. And walking to the school bus, students pass wheelchairs and oxygen tanks as nonchalantly as if they were backpacks and notebooks. The Hebrew Home at Riverdale, a nursing home on a picturesque stretch of the Hudson River in the Bronx, has gone beyond its calling as a house for the old, playing host to the young with an innovative public high school right within its walls. The students, all of whom have learning disabilities, get vocational training to prepare them for a job at the home or elsewhere, all in the peculiar setting of a school where the old far outnumber the young. “It’s as though they have 840 grandparents keeping an eye on them every day,” said Daniel Reingold, CEO of the Hebrew Home and the school’s founder. Reingold started the program around 1995 to address a pair of problems — the difficulty in filling entry-level positions at the home and a “lost generation” of young people born to drug-addicted mothers during the crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s. After about a decade, the program — called HOPE, for health care offers permanent employment — shifted focus to students with autism and intellectual disabilities, a population Reingold sees as akin to the home’s residents. “They are both isolated,” he said. “Older adults in this country are isolated, and young people with learning disabilities can be isolated.” The school day begins like any other, with morning-weary students filing off yellow buses into a cafeteria where they eat egg-and-cheese sandwiches and sip apple juice. Twelve students, all wearing pale green polo shirts with the HOPE logo affixed, await the start of the day’s schedule, when any signs of this being a normal high school fade away. With the prodding of their teacher, Nick Kinas, they shuffle off to work assignments across this sprawling complex. Indeasia Watson, 21, settles into a nurse’s station, keying data into a computer before being sent on an errand to a downstairs lab. She picks up lancets and diabetic strips, balancing a stack of small cartons between her hands and chin as she passes women in wheelchairs preparing for a music therapy class. For some students — including Watson, who says she will aim for a clerical job after graduating — the school inspires them to consider for the first time what career they might pursue. For others, their experience at the Hebrew Home may be guided by their stated interests. A girl who likes doing hair and nails works answering phones at the home’s beauty parlour; a boy who dreams of working as a graphic designer helps in the home’s art studio. Keith Brown, 20, recalls not wanting to start at the Hebrew Home, nervous about its size and unfamiliarity. Two years later, he’s a fixture, squeezing his tall frame into a supply room where he stores shipments of cups, straws and nebulizer medications, then off to a trash room loading empty boxes into a compactor. Brown completed training needed to allow him to skip the school bus and take the subway and public bus himself, an hour each way from his home in Harlem. That qualified him to apply for a paid job at the home; he was hired for a weekend position pushing wheelchair-bound residents to appointments and activities. “I was shocked!” a beaming Brown said of his hiring, as he awaited his first paycheque. Students must be able to communicate to take part in the program, and the home targets candidates who exhibit independence and compassion. Because dealing with change can be especially challenging for learning-disabled students, the school specifically imposes shifting work assignments to help them develop the coping skills they may need to later hold a job. Participants generally are placed from the nearby special-education Public School 721X, with the goal to provide enough training that they can pursue jobs at the nursing home, Jacobi Medical Center or Montefiore Medical Center, which also host students, or elsewhere. Though work assignments account for the bulk of the school day, students also attend class and have independent tutoring sessions. The classes largely focus on real-world skills and some of the intricacies of working in a nursing home. One morning, the class gathers around a round table in the nursing home’s library, talking about personal finances and the difference between budgeting for “wants” and “needs.” Off to one side, the home’s bingo equipment is stowed; next door, a chair yoga class is under way; and through one door, a resident with a walker drifts in to peruse the nonfiction racks and spreads of newspapers and magazines. Another day, the students discuss the importance of proper body language and tone of voice, the cognitive declines some of their elders might be experiencing and dots on resident ID badges that indicate a swallowing problem. “What does DNR mean?” Kinas asks. “Does it mean do not run? No, it means do not resuscitate.” A decade ago, Kinas was clocking 16-hour days on Wall Street as a portfolio manager and trader when he sought more meaning in his work. He went back to school for a master’s in special education, teaching high school math and science for six years before arriving at the Hebrew Home two years ago. The career change has amounted to a “rebirth” for him, the 58-year-old says, emphatic about how rewarding it feels to help prepare these young people for the world. “These kids saved me in a lot of ways,” he says. “They’ve taught me as much as I’ve taught them.” The school aims for a similar interchange between the students and residents. The high schoolers share favourite rock and hip-hop songs, and the elders offer hits from the 1940s and 1950s. Students show residents their smartphones and play music videos and anime on YouTube, the residents in turn share stories from their long lives, including one centenarian who shared childhood memories of horse-drawn buggies with his young audience. “It’s a history lesson,” Kinas says, “but it’s a history lesson from someone who’s living and breathing.” There are life lessons, too. Death is a nursing home mainstay and when the students notice a resident is gone, it forces them to talk about it and process the loss. Channel Reid, who graduated from the HOPE program 12 years ago and now works in the cafeteria, still remembers the first time a favourite resident died. “They believe in you, they give you this love,” she said. “Some of them are just so sweet it’s hard to not be attached to them.” That tenderness is on display as 90-year-old Selma Bachner sits in a window-lined corner, with a view of birds hopping tree branches and a haze of fog along the Hudson shoreline, with the George Washington Bridge poking out in the distance. She is awaiting her student, 19-year-old Louie Garcia, whom she works with on reading, helping when he stumbles on a word and cajoling him as he answers a workbook’s comprehension questions. “It makes me feel darn good to help a young person,” Bachner says. For all the uniqueness of the school, its students are hard-pressed to recognize its singularity, simply seeing it as their daily routine as other schools before it were. At lunch, they munch on honey barbecue chips and pop headphones in their ears or tap away on their phones, and as they await the arrival of buses to take them home at dismissal, they cluster near an exit giggling. Reminders of how different the school really is are constant, though, from a classroom discussion led by Kinas touching on the loneliness and sadness some feel as they grow old to the longer-term experience of residents’ growing medical needs. Garcia winds through the home’s hallways, delivering mail to seniors one afternoon after his tutoring session, a job he’s been doing for several months and which has sparked his interest in working for the Postal Service when he’s done with school. He knows, looking at those he passes, that he too will grow old one day, that he may have trouble walking or breathing or all the other problems on display before him. It’s just a fact of life, he says. “If I picture it in my mind,” he said of old age, “I’ll be like all the other residents.” —— Sedensky can be reached at msedensky//twitter.com/sedensky"
256,"Oct 11, 2017","VANCOUVER — Severely ill Canadians who don’t qualify for medical help in dying will suffer even longer while they wait to find out whether the federal government has violated their right to a medically assisted death after a court ruling in B.C. on Wednesday, a civil liberties group says. Chief Justice Christopher Hinkson of the British Columbia Supreme Court said the government should be given a second chance to argue the findings of fact that were used by the country’s top court to overturn a ban on assisted dying in 2015. The federal government’s legislation, which came into effect last year, needs to be assessed on “relevant, current evidence,” Hinkson wrote. Barring the courts from considering the most up-to-date information would prevent a judge from being able to decide what evidence is important and how much weight it should be given, he added. The B.C. Civil Liberties Association is spearheading a lawsuit launched in June 2016 that challenges the federal law, which it says is more limited than the assisted-dying regime the Supreme Court of Canada envisioned in its landmark ruling, referred to as the Carter decision. Caily DiPuma, the group’s litigation director, said she is disappointed in Wednesday’s decision but does not believe it undermines the underlying legal challenge. “While today’s outcome is unfortunate, it’s really just a bump in the road,” she said outside the courthouse in Vancouver. “We’re focused on the ultimate outcome. We defeated these arguments in Carter in 2015 and we’re confident we’ll defeat them again.” In the meantime, people will continue to suffer while the case proceeds through the courts, she added. “Every day that this issue remains unresolved is a day that a person in Canada … spends trapped in intolerable suffering … under a law that unjustly restricts medical access to assisted death.” Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould said the government would continue to defend its legislation. “It strikes the appropriate balance between respecting the personal autonomy of those seeking access to medical assistance in dying and protecting the rights of vulnerable Canadians,” she said in a statement. The federal government asserted in earlier submissions that new arguments are required because the latest case involves different plaintiffs, a different legal regime and a different set of issues compared with 2015. Shanaaz Gokool, head of Dying With Dignity Canada, said Wednesday’s ruling comes at the expense of people already experiencing intolerable pain and suffering, who should have found relief under the decision from the Supreme Court of Canada. “Obviously, we’re very disappointed in the ruling,” she said. “It means that we can expect a lengthy trial, and a very expensive one.” Gokool said she is aware of at least four people who have gone to Switzerland in the past year to have an assisted death because they were ineligible in Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled medical assistance in dying should be available to capable, consenting Canadian adults suffering intolerably from “grievous and irremediable” medical conditions. Two B.C. women were included as plaintiffs alongside the civil liberties association, though one woman has since died. Robyn Moro, 68, suffered from Parkinson’s disease but was initially denied medical help in dying because her natural death was not considered reasonably foreseeable. She was added to the case in May and ended her life with the help of a doctor in late August following an Ontario Superior Court ruling that clarified how imminent a natural death had to be to qualify for assisted dying. The second plaintiff, Julia Lamb, 26, has spinal muscular atrophy, a degenerative disease she worries will lead to years of unbearable suffering by robbing her of the ability to use her hands and forcing her to use a ventilator to breathe and a feeding tube to eat. A trial date has not been set and it is uncertain whether the civil liberties association will file an appeal to Wednesday’s decision, DiPuma said. twitter.com/gwomand"
257,"Oct 09, 2017","Wanda Morris What’s your life worth? If you were to die because a texting driver ran you down or a surgeon left a scalpel behind after an operation, what compensation would the courts award your loved ones? If you’re over 65, it’s very little. If you live in B.C., it’s probably nothing at all. Before any payment for a wrongful death, the surviving spouse, adult children or estate has to prove the death was due to negligence and that damages resulted. Proving negligence is extremely costly — and showing damages can be impossible. The Canadian Medical Protective Association, which insures most doctors in our country, almost always fights claims extremely aggressively, no matter their merits. This can discourage frivolous claims, but it can also create real hardship for survivors. Expenses for expert testimony and other costs will likely range from $100,000 to $150,000 just to bring a case to court. Then there’s the cost of a legal team to prepare and prosecute the case. Older Canadians face a second challenge: Even if death is proven to be due to negligence, damage awards are small. To calculate the value of a lost life, the courts look to the earnings potential the deceased lost, and the hardship the death imposes on dependents. The death of someone in, or near, retirement, does not result in significant lost earnings, so courts award small financial damages. Courts can award damages for other non-financial losses (called non-pecuniary losses), but the amounts vary between provinces and are generally small to inconsequential. The loss of a loved one is likely to lead to the highest award in Ontario, where courts can award damages for loss of companionship, but any award is still unlikely to exceed the costs of bringing a case to court. In B.C., where damages are limited to a few thousand dollars to cover the cost of a funeral, anyone bringing such a case would end up losing money even if they won. If anything further was needed to prove the system is fundamentally flawed, it’s that negligent doctors and drivers are better off killing us rather than injuring us. If a doctor operates on the wrong body part, or a driver leaves us paralyzed, their insurance will have to cover our rehabilitation and ongoing support. It is heartbreaking for families to watch as those who negligently kill aren’t held accountable, but there is a bigger societal cost as well. Our actions are shaped, consciously and unconsciously, by their consequences. Imagine you are unpacking groceries and need to store a bottle of water and a bottle of scotch. We might toss around the water bottle, while cradling the bottle of scotch. We don’t want either of them to break, but it’s a lot easier to clean up and get over spilled water. When medical professionals work in a system where they learn, even if just at an unconscious level, that the wrongful death of a senior has no consequences, their level of care and attention may decline. When a wrongful death case is proven in court, damages should be awarded to the survivors or the estate for the loss of enjoyment of that individual’s golden years. With the increasing health and life expectancies of older Canadians, anything else is ageist. It’s time to throw out the old rules and ensure all lives are valued — in the courts and everywhere else.

258,"Oct 04, 2017","In most provinces, pediatricians who treat children outnumber by a wide margin the geriatricians who specialize in treating elderly people. In B.C., there is a Ministry of Children and Family Development, but nothing comparable for seniors — even though seniors now outnumber children. Plus, there is a hospital dedicated to children in Metro Vancouver. But not one for the elderly. “How come?” asks Dan Levitt, an adjunct professor in gerontology at Simon Fraser University. “Seniors are put in nursing homes while a child with a similar condition stays at home and often has full-time aids in school. Our society has to change and embrace aging.” In an effort to raise awareness, Levitt is part of a group sponsoring a workshop featuring Eloy van Hal, one of the Dutch founders of De Hogeweyk, also known as “Dementia Village.” It has been described as one of the world’s most innovative developments in the care for people with dementia. Van Hal is speaking Thursday at the Fairmont Vancouver Hotel. Within 20 years, it is estimated that one-quarter of B.C.’s population will be 65 years of age or older. Levitt, who is also an adjunct professor in nursing at the University of B.C., singled out “ageism” as an underlying reason behind the lack of resources for the elderly. “We have gerontophobia,” he said. “We’re afraid of becoming that group of people who are discriminated against. Why are seniors not getting the resources? Part of this conversation is to move the needle every so slightly on public opinion on the importance of seniors.” Levitt said he wasn’t aware of any plans for a B.C. version of Dementia Village. “There are projects going up that aren’t necessarily carbon copies, but are using the same principles,” he said. De Hogeweyk is located in Weesp near Amsterdam. It is a complete village with 1.5 hectares of streets, squares and gardens, as well as a theatre, café and grocery store where 152 people live in 23 houses. All venues are staffed with specially trained employees. The buildings form a border so residents can wander without anyone worrying about their safety. This is particularly important for some people with dementia who experience “sundowning”: wandering at the end of the day when the sun sets. “People wander away from nursing homes because they’re bored and lonely and helpless and want something outside,” Levitt said. “In Dementia Village, everything you want is there.” For the past two years, van Hal has worked as a consultant to Vivium Care Group, which includes Dementia Village. Van Hal, who spoke two years ago in Richmond, is expected to expand on the story of how De Hogeweyk was built. He will talk about specifics such as adapting building codes and working with government regulators who often err on the side of safety rather than in favour of enhancing the quality of life, Levitt said. The idea of building a nursing home as a standalone building next to a hospital is increasingly rare around the world, Levitt said. Those older models are being replaced with centres that create a sense of community for residents. Why shouldn’t a residential care centre include a library and pool that everyone can use, Levitt said. Or a daycare? “If you look at different global models in Australia, France, Switzerland, and Germany, many countries are no longer building standalone hospital-style nursing homes,” said Levitt, executive director of Tabor Village in Abbotsford. “They just don’t exist anymore.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
259,"Oct 03, 2017","When most people think of dangerous jobs in B.C., it’s probably a safe bet that a health care assistant isn’t on their radar. According to workplace statistics, it should be. The women and men working as frontline caregivers in residential care homes and hospitals have a workplace injury rate of 8.7 per 100 workers — four times the B.C. average of 2.1 for all workers. Outdoor work in the forestry industry remains the province’s most dangerous occupation, with an injury rate of 25 injuries per 100 workers. Health care assistants, however, register more time-loss injuries than transport truck drivers, construction trades helpers and labourers, and carpenters. There is one statistic where HCAs lead all occupations, according to Stephen Symon, manager of health care and social services, industry and labour services at WorkSafeBC. At 16,000 time-loss injury claims between 2012 and 2016, HCAs had the most of any occupation in B.C. Symon said during that same period, time-loss claims among HCAs rose 11 per cent. Symon was at a WorkSafeBCconferenceon Tuesday at the Italian Cultural Centre that brought together 250 health care assistants for the first time in Metro Vancouver. HCAs met to learn best practices among themselves and about the importance of staying healthy while at work. Symon saidWorkSafeBCbelieves that many HCA injuries are preventable and can be addressed with better safe-work practices. Health care assistants file so many time-loss claims because they are working in a very difficult environment, he said. In a residential care facility, for example, HCAs have to deal on a daily basis with patients who have any combination of dementia, physical mobility challenges and other complex health needs. The most common type of injuries are due to lifting, pulling and pushing patients. The second are workplace violence incidents where patients hit, kick, bite or in some way strike the caregiver. “That is something they face on a daily basis,” Symon said in an interview. “We have made what I think are significant improvements with mechanical and ceiling lifts and other devices to minimize the amount they have to lift and pull. I would say that we are still working on what would be best practices for the prevention of violence. There needs to be more.” According to WorkSafeBC, 89 per cent of HCA claims are filed by women; 22 per cent are older than age 55. HCAs in residential and long-term care accounted for 61 per cent of injury claims in 2016. There are more than 32,000 HCAs in B.C. “This conference is about celebrating health care assistants and the hard work that they do and the very challenging job they have,” Symon said. Jul Parojinog was one of the health care assistants attending theHearts and Hands Conference. She said during her health care assistant program at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, she was taught about the importance of de-escalating a situation and of recognizing that there is always a reason behind someone’s behaviour. She told of one elderly man who has had a stroke. He regularly forgets to take his medication, but doesn’t like being reminded to take it. He finds it very difficult to accept his new limitations. He also isn’t always aware that what he thinks he communicates isn’t what he’s really doing. Frustrated, he lashes out with words that can be hurtful, she said. “We have to be patient and clarify and always check if what he’s saying is what he means,” she said. “It’s frustrating for him because he’s a very smart man. We have to be more understanding.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
260,"Sep 29, 2017","Women face economic disadvantages throughout their lifetimes, but it is near the end of their lives that it is most acute. Nowhere is that more evident than in Metro Vancouver, which has Canada’s highest percentage of people living in low-income households. The 2016 census data for the region indicates that the percentage of women living in low-income households is 7.5-per-cent higher than men. But past the age of 65? The percentage of poor women jumps to 15.8 per cent. “This is structural patriarchy,” says Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s City Program, who put the census poverty numbers through a gender lens. “The entire experience of doing this has taught me we have to view things through a gender lens. If you want to do something in terms of policy, you have to understand the cleavages in society, and age and gender are two of them.” The reasons for the gendered poverty gap range from the facts that women live longer, earn an average of 25 per cent less throughout their lives than men, often take time away from the workplace to have children and are able to contribute less to pension plans and retirement funds. Among the oldest of today’s seniors, married women were much less likely to have done paid work outside the home, while the high mortality rates during the Second World War meant many women never married. Across Metro, 16.5 per cent of seniors live below the low-income threshold of $22,133 in after-tax income for a single or $31,201 for a couple. The largest concentration of poor seniors is in Vancouver, which alone has 19,115 of them. Break it down by gender, and across the region 17.6 per cent of poor seniors are women compared with 15.2 per cent of men. But that gap widens substantially in some municipalities. In Langley City, one-in-four senior women live in poverty. In White Rock, one in six senior women are poor. But the gap between poor female and male elders is seven percentage points. In Vancouver, the gender gap is less than one per cent, but still means that there are nearly 11,500 more poor elderly women than men. In Chinatown, Gastown and the Downtown Eastside, 71 per cent of poor seniors are women. “They’re out on the streets ‘binning’ for survival,” says Yan. The small, wealthy enclaves of Belcarra, Anmore and Lion’s Bay are outliers. Not only is the prevalence of low-income households a third or less than the regional average, they are the only places where more men live in low-income households. In Belcarra, all of the 6.3 per cent of seniors living in low-income households are men. In many ways, the results are unsurprising. But they are disturbing especially when put in the context of other data that indicates between 2005 and 2015 the percentage of all low-income seniors jumped by an average of 22 per cent. A more startling comparison is that in 1995 the seniors’ poverty rate was 3.9 per cent. Now, it’s more than four times that. It means that many — if not most — of the gains that were made during the 1980s and ’90s to lift seniors out of poverty have been eroded. Couple that with the fact that tax cuts have contributed to a reduction in spending on many public services that affect women more than men. The cost of care for both children and seniors has risen, while funding for all levels of education, including post-secondary, has dropped. Before the 2016 federal budget, theBroadbent Institutepointed out that Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement had fallen to 60 per cent of median income in 2016 from 76 per cent in 1980. It noted that poverty rates will continue to increase as long as OAS and GIS are indexed to inflation, while average earnings rise more quickly. It also noted that nearly half of Canadian households with adults aged 55 to 64 have no accrued, employer-sponsored pension benefits. Their median retirement assets are barely over $3,000. Even accounting for total net worth, only 28 per cent of Canadian seniors without employer pension plans have saved only enough to last five years. For the first time in 2017, the federal government put its budget through a gender lens — 60 specific measures — to determine whether or how spending (and presumably cuts) would affect women and men. But provincial and municipal governments also need to consider the gendered effects of policies as they plan for a future with more seniors and what services are essential to their long-term physical, mental and social well-being. Among the things to be considered are livable wages to allow for increased retirement savings. Pension improvements. Affordable housing for every age group, as well as accessible and affordable public transit. More funding for senior-oriented programming in community centres. Improvements to both home care and residential care. And even simpler things, like making sure that pedestrian crossing lights stay on long enough for seniors to cross. Because, according toprojections cited by Statistics Canada, by 2031 there will be 9.6 million seniors. Of those, 5.1 million will be women, accounting for nearly a quarter of the total female population. By 2061, there could be 7.1 million senior women, including 60,700 centenarians. Women over age 65 will comprise nearly a third of Canada’s total female population. But these are not just statistics. These are our grandmothers, mothers, aunts, sisters, wives and lovers. And they’ll need all of us to help care for them. dbramham@postmedia.com twitter: @daphnebramham CLICK HEREto report a typo. Is there more to this story?

261,"Sep 27, 2017","The stories are horrific enough that a rational person might conclude that the only solution is to not grow old. At Evergreen Care Centre at Lion’s Gate Hospital, seniors live four to a room with no privacy, and often with roommates whose cognitive and physical abilities are often widely different from their own. At that facility — the province’s largest complex care facility — the bathtubs have been taken out. “Residents are essentially taken on a rubberized bath stretcher and hosed off in the ‘tub room,’” says Judi Georgetti, who retired last spring from Capilano University after a decade of teaching in the health care assistant program and four decades as a registered nurse. The reason for the change, she was told, is that it took too much time to fill the tub, bathe the resident, then clean and disinfect the tub. “I was so horrified that I told my director that I could never supervise students in such a place because it was antithetical to all that I had been taught and all that I believed.” A spokesman from Vancouver Coastal Health confirmed that the bathtubs were removed a number of years ago and were replaced with walk-in showers, chairs and handheld shower heads as a safety precaution so residents can’t slip and caregivers don’t injure their backs lifting them. At another facility, a woman told me that her husband must wear diapers because care aides aren’t available to get them to the toilet in time. He has Parkinson’s. To keep his limbs mobile, he does a lot of walking, stretching and muscle building. He sweats a lot. Yet he gets help showering only once a week, unless he pays an extra $28 for a second one. “When I pick him up on Saturdays to bring him home for dinner, he smells so bad sometimes I can hardly stand it. The first thing I do at home is help him shower.” She asked that I not use their names, and she refused to name the facility. She fears retaliation against her husband. Another family initially offered to share photos of what they described as the filthy conditions at the facility where their matriarch is living. After several email exchanges, they decided not to. They, too, feared that the staff might make the woman’s already bleak life worse. Their stories add flesh to numbers in a survey released recently by the B.C. Seniors Advocate that quantified the views of 9,605 residents and 9,604 family members in 292 of the province’s nursing homes. Half the residents rated their overall care as poor to good, while 67 per cent of their families rated it as good or excellent. But where too many are failing is in the provision of personal care. Nearly two-thirds of residents, and 71 per cent of their relatives, say the residents never or rarely bathe or shower as often as they want. One in four never, rarely or only sometimes get to the toilet when needed. Overwhelmingly, families told me that fear was precisely why they didn’t want their names used. But the majority surveyed said they felt they could complain without fear of retaliation. Of course, almost half said they only sometimes, rarely or never complained. Ivan Rubcic offered a reality check. His aunt, a wheelchair-bound widow with no children, has been living in care for four years. The government pays 80 per cent of her costs. What would enhance her life most is something the government or care aides can’t provide — more visits from her extended family. While it’s easy to criticize the care homes, he says, “For poor people, the care homes work. There is a vast amount of improvements that could be implemented. But where is the money going to come from?” Rubcic raised the pragmatic, problematic reality. Over the past few years, the average age of residents has risen to 88. The acuity levels of those suffering from dementia/Alzheimer’s is much higher than it used to be. There are more people with multiple health issues. And many people’s expectations about the kind of care that our loved ones get or what we deserve are much higher than before. The Health Ministry has set 3.36 hours of direct care a day as a guideline for all nursing homes, regardless of whether they are owned and operated by government, a non-profit or a company — 70 per cent of residential care is delivered by the private sector under contract with the government through the health authorities. Butdata compiled by the B.C. Care Providers Associationfrom health authorities’ report indicates that 178 non-government care homes and 66 government ones failed to meet the guideline. The direct-care hours range from a low of the 2.68 hours per person in Vancouver Coastal Health’s private facilities to a high of 4.02 hours in government-owned facilities in Northern Health. To meet the 3.36 hours a day standard, the association figures that would require hiring another 1,500 staff. Where would caring, qualified workers come from since many care homes already have trouble finding staff? Where would the money come from? And what happens in the coming years now that Canadians over 65 already outnumber those under 15? Answering those questions might require some exceptional, out-of-the-box thinking — like in Japan. There, the demographics skew even older than in Canada, and they are experimenting withrobots. Here, thoughtful people have been making recommendations and suggesting innovations for more than a decade. What we need is action because if the situation is critical now, it will only get worse as the tsunami of elderly arrive in full force. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @daphnebramham"
262,"Sep 23, 2017","With one thin, veined hand over the other, he tapped in time as the Borealis String Quartet played a very special concert. Across the room, a woman nodded her head along with the beat, while a man closed his eyes, perhaps transported somewhere else. Still, another woman looked slightly alarmed as violinist Patricia Shih occasionally rose and twisted in her chair, fully engaged with the music. Of course, there were critics. “They’re playing too loud,” a man said to the woman next to him, apparently believing that he was sotto voce. But the applause was warm and generous for the quartet in residence at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, which has recently performed as part of the Beethoven series at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and at the Illsley Ball Nordstrom Recital Hall in Seattle. The concert at Chartwell Carlton Gardens was the first of two concerts that the quartet played Thursday in Burnaby. Both were in residential care homes where the average age of residents is upwards of 86, and most suffer from mild to acute dementia. The scientific evidence is that the last of the brain receptors that are affected by acute dementia is the one for music. Beyond that, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence from staff and family that music has a calming effect. But for David Lemon, it’s not about health benefits. It’s about pleasure. “Music does for them what it does for everyone else. It give pleasure,” he said when we talked before the concert began. “It is extraordinarily rare not to be touched by music.” Lemon, a former insurance executive and owner of Vancouver’s Magic Flute record store, founded the non-profitHealth Arts Societyin 2006 specifically to produce Concerts in Care for nursing home residents. “Culture, leisure and recreation are taken for granted outside of care homes,” says Lemon. “We have to do better for the people who live here because we’re all on a trajectory. Age is not an illness. We change — fundamentally and remarkably — very little.” By the end of 2017, the society will have produced 8,000 concerts in B.C. and hundreds more in the seven other provinces where Lemon has set up individual societies to ensure that the programs are tailored to local needs. There’s been classical music, opera, jazz, special programming for audiences of different cultures and, in Saskatchewan, they’ve even done country and western. All of the performers are professional musicians. “It would be condescending to say that those in residential care don’t get to have the best musicians performing for them,” Lemon says. Thursday’s performances were part of the 40-concert series funded by theB.C. Care Providers Associationto mark its 40th anniversary celebration. Like Lemon, CEO Daniel Fontaine believes that it’s not enough to focus on the quality of care. There needs to be more attention paid to quality of life seniors have within these care facilities. “I’d like to make things like this standard fare,” Fontane said before the concert began. “It shouldn’t only happen because David (Lemon) is able to stumble on a grant from here or there.” The association wants the provincial government to establish a “quality of life fund” of $100 a month for each of the 27,000 B.C. residents in care homes to be used for recreational, therapeutic and social services that currently aren’t widely available. The need for enhancement of those services was certainly reflected in the responses to a massive survey of residents and their families in 292 care homes, which was released last week by the B.C Seniors Advocate. It’s one of thereport’stop three recommendations. But the top priority is, and ought to be, on improved quality of care. Even though British Columbia is spending $1.9 billion on seniors’ long-term residential care this year, the quality of that care got mixed reviews. A stunning 62 per cent of the 9,605 residents surveyed said they don’t get baths and showers as often as they’d like, while one in four rarely or only sometimes get the help they need when they want to go to the toilet. But there is more to being human and being alive than simply eating, sleeping and breathing our way through each day as we inexorably head to the end. And, like it or not, end-of-life care for our parents and for ourselves is going to take an increasingly large share of government spending over the next several decades. Two years ago, the Conference Board of Canadaforecastthat by 2026 there would be a 71-per-cent increase in the number of seniors needing continuing care supports. By 2046, it estimates that spending will have to increase to $177.3 billion, from $28.3 billion in 2011. As the demand rises, determining how to provide for all of the needs of aging citizens is an urgent priority. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP2KT7pKEow&feature=youtu.be • Read the full report online atseniorsadvocatebc.ca dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter.com/daphnebramham CLICK HEREto report a typo.

263,"Sep 15, 2017","A groundbreaking new survey from theOffice of the Seniors Advocatehas been met with support from B.C.’s largest industry association representing the seniors-care sector. Every Voice Countsfound that staffing levels were a major concern of almost 10,000 seniors and family members who responded. Staffing in residential care facilities in B.C. needs to be increased so that seniors feel more engaged and have more individual freedom, according to the survey released Friday. “While staff overall are caring and respectful, consistent feedback is that there simply are not enough staff to ensure residents’ needs are taken care of when they need to be,” Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie said in the survey’s conclusion. “Inadequate staffing lead to inconsistency among care aides and ultimately an erosion of important interpersonal interactions between staff and residents.” Lack of staff, Mackenzie said, not only reduces someone’s ability to choose when to take a bath or have a meal, it also means seniors aren’t being engaged in social and leisure activities. Seniors, she said, want more freedom. Some, but not all, say they have an overall feeling of loneliness — despite living and eating meals with other people. “A better connection with staff on a personal level and the ability to spend time with residents they might have more in common with is a clear need,” Mackenzie said. The survey acknowledges that if you went to a care facility during a meal, you’d find residents who were very satisfied and others who weren’t. “The results of the survey do not show a residential care system that is failing overall,” Mackenzie said. “The results do show that it is failing some people some of the time and that overall it is a system with room for improvement, and in some areas, much improvement is needed.” Daniel Fontaine, CEO of the B.C. Care Providers Association, whose members care for more than 27,000 seniors annually, said the survey’s eight recommendations align with those made by his association in reports it released in2014andearlier this year. Fontaine said he is encouraged by the survey but also concerned by how it fails to fully address the cost of implementing its recommendations and whether adequate funding is available. He said $500 million in funding over fours years, announced by the previous provincial government earlier this year, will help provide 3.36 hours of direct care daily for seniors — one of the survey’s eight recommendations. But he wonders how the others will be funded. His association has advocated for a “Seniors Quality of Life Fund,” estimated to cost $25 to 30 million annually, which would address some of the issues highlighted in the survey. It would provide seniors in publicly-funded care with up to $100 each month to pay for such services as access to better food options, group arts and crafts programs and recreational therapy. “We were hoping that the seniors advocate would have endorsed that and supported that, and we assume that she would endorse the general concept, but we’re still waiting to hear whether or not that will be the case,” he said. However, Fontaine said the new Ministry of Health seems to have “a genuine interest” in improving seniors’ care. “I’m hopeful that they’ll take our recommendations and also the seniors advocate’s recommendations and build that into the upcoming February budget,” he said. Health minister Adrian Dix commended the massive efforts by the Office of the Seniors Advocate and care home residents and staff in producing the survey, which he said will be an important tool in improving the residential-care system. Dix said that his top priority will be ensuring the recommended standard of 3.36 daily direct-care hours. “Reaching that threshold allows us also to respond to other recommendations” in the survey, he said. Anne Kang, Parliamentary Secretary for Seniors, said she’s been meeting with seniors and heard from them many of the concerns that are identified in the survey. Kang said she looks forward to improving the quality of life of seniors in residential care but will also work to improve homecare services so that seniors may spend more time with their families and home communities. The survey, which cost $1.3 million, was a mammoth undertaking. More than 14 months in planning, it included more than 100 questions for seniors in care and family members. Of the 22,000 seniors in 292 care facilities, 9,605 completed the survey for a 43 per cent response rate. Every Voice Counts is the first time in Canada residents in all care facilities were interviewed at the same time using the same survey. The survey had a pilot project in May and June 2016 and was completed between September 2016 and May 2017. It was coordinated with five health authorities, more than 100 operators and in languages other than English. Mackenzie said the report is not the “voice” of seniors in care but the “voices” of residential care. “The stories, the feedback and the results paint a picture of a rich and diverse group of men and women who, through circumstances beyond their control, have found themselves living with folks many of them don’t really know, eating food that some like more than others, waiting for help that is sometimes too long in coming, and lacking the freedom to go and do what they want when they want,” Mackenzie said. “We should all be humbled by the grace and equanimity demonstrated by seniors in residential care in this province and recognize how deserving they are of our care and attention.” Survey questions were grouped in nine categories ranging from personal control and food to physician care and hand washing. Below are selected responses from residents and family members about their overall experience: • 88 per cent of family members who have seen aggressive residents report that staff handled the matter appropriately. • 80 per cent of residents said they can decide for themselves what clothes they can wear and how they’ll spend their time. • 77 per cent would likely recommend the facility to others. • 65 per cent of family members rated the facility eight out of 10 or higher. • 57 per cent of seniors in care say the facility feels like home. • 52 per cent say they don’t really get to eat when they want. • 50 per cent rated their quality of care as very good or excellent. • 50 per cent say it is rare or never happens that they get to bathe or shower as often as they want. • 46 per cent report there is no one in the facility that they consider a close friend. • 46 per cent of staff regularly make time for friendly conversation. • 41 per cent of residents say there is not enough variety in their food. • 40 per cent say they don’t want to be in residential care. • 25 per cent say that only sometimes, rarely, or never do they get help to go to the toilet. • 25 per cent of family members say they’re instructed where to wash their hands. • 24 per cent of seniors in care homes say they rarely or never get to decide for themselves when to get up in the morning. 14:months spent in consultation to plan the survey. 103:questions in survey of seniors in residential care. 292:number of care facilities. 3:the maximum number of times each resident was approached to see if they could/would complete survey. 27,000:total of seniors in a residential care facility in B.C. 22,000:seniors asked to participate. 9,605:completed survey. 43:per cent response rate. 104:questions asked of residents’ most frequent visitor who is often, but not ways, a family member. 19,906:surveys sent to most frequent visitors. 9,604:responses. 48:per cent response rate. • Increasing staffing levels in care facilities. • Implementing flexibility around when and how care, services and activities are delivered. • Adding activities on weekends and evenings and creating more meaningful experiences. • Providing better physician care and/or exploring increasing the role of nurse practitioners. • Improving the meal experience. • Providing ongoing education for all care staff on the importance of resident emotional well-being. kevingriffin@postmedia.com"
264,,"The picture that B.C. seniors paint of daily life within 292 of the province’s licensed residential care facilities is bleak even though the majority feel safe and believe they are being looked after by qualified people. Nearly half are lonely with no friends or even someone within their residence who shares their interests. There is little opportunity for affection, let alone romance. Part of the reason is that seniors are housed with others who have “very different physical and cognitive abilities, backgrounds and languages,” according to thereportreleased Friday by Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie. “Yet, many of them dine together and have the same calendar of activities.” The report noted that the 9,605 residents who responded to the 103 questions included only those with higher levels of physical and cognitive functions. Of the 22,000 residents in the 292 facilities, 57 per cent were excluded because of their physical and cognitive limitations. Still, even those with higher cognitive abilities are almost never asked for their advice or help even though two-thirds say that staff knows little or nothing at all about their life experiences. So much for respecting the wisdom of elders. Most are bored, especially on evenings and weekends when more than a third said activities are rarely planned. But what is truly disturbing are the intimate details. One in four never, rarely, or only sometimes get help going to the toilet when they need it. That likely contributes to the statistic that almost two-thirds of care-home residents are deemed to be usually or always incontinent. Baths and showers? Nearly two-thirds of residents don’t get them as often as they’d like. Yet, that may actually underestimate the problem because 82 family members who were asked the same question said their loved ones never, rarely or only sometimes had showers or baths when they needed or wanted them. This would seem incomprehensible except that I know how hard my mother had to repeatedly fight to get these most basic services for my father, who was paralyzed and couldn’t speak. But there’s more. A quarter of residents say that staff never, rarely or only sometimes tries to relieve their physical discomfort. A quarter say they have little control over when they get up in the morning, when they eat and what they eat. Most don’t get food they like. Many say their food isn’t served at the proper temperature. For those who need help at mealtime, more than a third don’t get it. For even the most personal of care, nearly half rarely have the same care aide even on weekdays and rarely do staff members who take time to have a friendly conversation. Given all of that, perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that 48 per cent have prescriptions for antidepressants. Fewer than half have doctors who visit when they’re sick. Fewer still have doctors who visit when they are well. Expanding the role of nurse practitioners might help, the report suggests because right now, too many seniors are ending up in emergency departments, are over-medicated or their medications are mismanaged. Right now, the B.C. Health Ministry requires a minimum of 3.36 hours of care for every resident every day. The report’s top recommendation is to increase that. But it will come down to money. The average resident’s care is subsidized by about $4,900 a month with the average cost per resident estimated at $6,400 monthly. Only 13 per cent of the seniors in care pay the maximum; half pay $1,600 or less. How much can the government afford given all of the other needs in the province for health care, affordable housing and education? The value of this report is that it provides baseline data for citizens and policy-makers to begin the discussion. The report also recommends more family engagement. But what of the seniors who either have no family close enough to do that or whose family members are already overwhelmed by the demands of young children and jobs? Family members responses to the survey reflect the ambivalence, stress and even guilt that many feel over having a loved one in a care facility. A third say they know that their loved ones don’t want to be there. But 91 per cent of them said a care facility is their loved one’s best option. B.C.’s care facilities are certainly not terrible. The majority feel that they get the services they need, that they live in a clean and safe environment. For most people, a care facility will never feel like home. But they need to be better because right now they are failing too many residents particularly when it comes to the provision of the most basic and intimate of care. dbramham@postmedia.com Twitter: @daphnebramham"
265,"Sep 04, 2017","After running a shop that catered to nostalgic British sugar fixes for more than 30 years, no one would have faulted Mary Carter for retiring when she closed her Steveston store last week. But the Birmingham-born great-grandmother of six has packed up her sweeties, her Cadbury’s chocolate and her meat pies and is reopening Mary’s British Home in downtown Langley in a 2,600-square-foot store that is more than double the size of her Steveston shop. At 82 years old. “I didn’t want to retire and just sit on a couch and watch television,” said Carter from the Langley home she shares with her son and family. “I was never that kind of person. I want to do things. I want to be somewhere.” In the shop that was a fixture in Steveston since the 1980s, ex-pat Brits and others could find licorice all-sorts, pear drops, humbugs, chewy toffees, lemon drops with sherbet on the inside, and packets of crisps (potato chips), along with meat and fruit pies. “It’s the tastes you are used to and you want that,” she said. “I like the British food.” Like meat pies in tins. “When you take them out of the tin and put it in the oven, it’s like puff pastry. There’s steak and kidney, and steak and mushrooms. I used to eat them when I was young, when we didn’t have fast food.” She closed the shop on Aug. 26, saying the 45- to 90-minute one-way commute, depending on tunnel traffic, from Langley was wearing on her, and that business had dropped off considerably over the past two to three years. But she will be missed by dozens of people who posted messages on the Steveston Insider Facebook page in response to a post about Carter closing shop. “Please say this is not happening!!!!!!!” wrote Janet Daniel. “Oh, no, sorry to see her go,” posted Francine Lee. “Always went in there when I was feeling homesick for some English sweets.” Added Mark Harman, who moved to Langley years ago: “Not a lot of us Brits left in Steveston.” Carter’s commute will now be just 10 minutes, and she said she is looking forward to a fresh start. “She will be a very welcome addition (to Langley),” said Brenda Quanstrom-Louth of the Downtown Langley Business Association. “There are so many people from the British Isles, and some of them long for the candies, and little jams and teas you can only get from Scotland, Ireland and England.” Carter grew up in an English shop that her mum opened in Birmingham when she was 18 months old and sold when Carter was 27. She and her husband, an electrician, immigrated to Toledo, Ohio, in the 1960s, where her sister lived, and had three children. Carter’s sister, a part-owner of a nightclub, floated the idea to Carter of partnering on a new franchise opportunity selling 15-cent hamburgers for a new chain called McDonald’s. Carter told her sister she wasn’t going to be serving what they called in Britain meat-on-a-bun: “Oh, stupid me.” After 10 years, they moved to Canada to join another sister, and Carter worked at a Sears clearance centre in North Delta and at other jobs for a few years. She and her husband opened a dried fruit and nut franchise in Coquitlam Centre, but it failed during the 1980s recession and they lost “lots of money” and their house before getting into the British import business. They moved from a Gastown location after rents before Expo 86 doubled and were expected to double again after Expo. “There was no way on Earth you could afford that. People just got so greedy,” she said, recalling the $900 rent. She has enjoyed spending five days a week in the Steveston shop, where she and her husband (who died in 2002) got to know their steady customers. “My customers are the best customers,” she said. “It’s amazing how attached you get to people. “It’s been so enjoyable. I haven’t got a store right now and I feel a little lost.” She said she plans to run the store “until my legs give way,” she said. “Until they carry you out of here, as one of my customers says.” She hasn’t got rich or started an empire but she’s spent most of her life doing what makes her happy. “It’s a labour of love,” she said. The new Mary’s British Home will open this month in the 20400 block of Fraser Highway in Langley."
266,"Aug 30, 2017","Increasing access to adult day programs for seniors is one of the recommendations by B.C.’s seniors advocate to address rising distress among family caregivers. Isobel Mackenzie said Wednesday that distress among primary caregivers has increased by seven to 31 per cent since her last report two years ago. In total numbers, that’s an increase of more than 1,000 caregivers in distress. Mackenzie wouldn’t describe the situation as a crisis. But she did say that a crisis tends to emerge incrementally. “What is going to happen is that inch by inch, year by year, we’re going to see the numbers rise of people in care facilities that could be cared for at home or assisted-living,” she said. “What we’re seeing is that an increasing number of the caregivers supporting our home-support clients are reporting that they’re in distress, which is a big trigger for giving up and placing mom or dad in a care facility.” Adult day programs provide supportive group activities one or two days a week, so a senior can continue living at home. It can include personal assistance, an organized program of activities and transportation to and from a venue. She said incentives are pushing caregivers to send ailing loved ones into residential care when 80 per cent of seniors say they would like more cost-effective home support. “Family members are throwing up their hands and moving people into care facilities,” Mackenzie said. “The evidence supports that we have people in our care facilities by virtue of their health assessments (who) could be cared for in their homes or in assisted-living.” Mackenzie pointed out that while 31 per cent of primary caregivers report being in distress, 69 per cent of them aren’t. “What that speaks to is the love and devotion among the overwhelming majority of our family caregivers,” she said. “It speaks to how the least we can do is provide a little more help.” Caregivers in Distress: A Growing Problem was released Wednesday in Victoria. Distress includes anger, depression or feeling unable to continue caregiving. The report looked at caregivers of people receiving publicly subsidized home support that provided a measurable data set from 2015-16. Mackenzie said at a news conference that there are as many as one million family caregivers in B.C. who provide an estimated $3.5 billion in unpaid help. She suggested that adult day programs could be increased by providing services on Saturdays and Sundays, and during the evening Monday to Friday. Other recommendations include increasing home support to keep pace with the growth in B.C.’s senior population. As well, respite needs to be provided in blocks of time large enough to allow a caregiver who can’t leave a loved one unattended to run errands and make appointments. Respite care can be provided in the home or in the community and gives the primary caregiver temporary relief from the emotional and physical demands of caring for a friend or family member. Mackenzie didn’t give a cost for implementing her five recommendations. Barbra Hopkins, president of the board of directors for Family Caregivers of B.C., is acutely aware of those demands. She is the primary caregiver for her 91-year-old mother, who lives in an independent living facility in Victoria. Hopkins, 63, helps her mom shop for groceries and pay bills, cleans her apartment, takes her to her appointments and sleeps on her couch when she’s feeling ill. She said Wednesday that Mackenzie’s recommendations make “total sense,” but won’t do much without adequate funding. “I hope that Isobel’s recommendations are taken to heart by the current government,” she said. “I think she’s got a very caring personality and she wants to make a difference.” Hopkins also worries that the data used in Mackenzie’s report doesn’t represent the true scope of strain experienced by caregivers. “The report, of course, falls a little bit short because she only has access to people who are already receiving care — her data and numbers are based on people already in the system,” Hopkins said. “We know there’s many, many more caregivers out there who aren’t even accessing any help.” Through Hopkin’s work as a financial adviser, with her organization and in caregiving, she has met families who are struggling and ill-prepared to handle potential health crises faced by the loved one in their care. Some find themselves overwhelmed as they take on more and more caregiving duties over time, Hopkins said. She said Family Caregivers of B.C. works to educate and support these people before they find themselves in crisis. Health Minister Adrian Dix told reporters Wednesday that he met with Mackenzie last week ahead of the release of her report. “What the report shows is what people know, is that the system supporting seniors is under stress, that not enough people are getting access to home support and to respite care,” Dix said. “That has an effect not just on seniors themselves, but on the huge number of British Columbians … who are providing support.” Asked if his ministry will act on the report’s five major recommendations, Dix said: “It’s my intention to act on the report, absolutely.” Dix said the ministry won’t wait until the B.C. government tables its budget in February before it begins that work. He noted that Premier John Horgan, in a mandate letter, tasked Dix with prioritizing work with the Parliamentary Secretary for Seniors “to improve and strengthen services to ensure seniors receive dignified and quality care.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com neagland@postmedia.com CLICK HEREto report a typo.

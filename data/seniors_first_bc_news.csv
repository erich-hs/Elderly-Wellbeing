Elder abuse has no single definition and the stories of abuse and neglect are varied and complex. Most people never like to consider themselves as a victim which is why we use the word survivor when speaking about those who have experienced abuse. Elder abuse is more common than you might think as it is often a hidden problem, but WHO estimates that1 in 6 older adults experience abuse worldwide. And a study by Elder Abuse Prevention Ontario revealed the prevalence of elder abuse in Canada for the last year was7.5% (physical, sexual, psychological and financial abuse) representing 695,248older Canadians. Currently, older adults are finding themselves more vulnerable than ever to incidences of financial abuse and otherCOVID-19 related scams.If you or someone you know is experiencing a scam or fraud, find more information from theCanadian Anti-Fraud Centre. Report the scam to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre. Their call centre is currently closed due to COVID-19, butyou can report the scam online. The more you know about elder abuse, the better equipped you will be to prevent it from happening to you and those you love. What elder abuse might look like the figure below explains. Figure 1– What elder abuse might look like. (Source WHO, 2016.https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/elder_abuse/Elder_abuse_infographic_EN.pdf?ua=1) It is most likely that abuse or neglect will be perpetrated by somebody well known or trusted. Most commonly experienced in a family setting (Wister, 2019). Which further muddies the water when it comes to recognizing that you are in an abusive scenario? Family members should be people that you can trust and it can be hard to spot abuse at the hands of a family member because it goes against everything you may believe to be true about those you are related to.

Unfortunately, fraudsters are using COVID-19 as an opportunity to trick the public, with seniors being most vulnerable.

Unfortunately, fraudsters are using COVID-19 as an opportunity to trick the public, with seniors being most vulnerable. It is becoming difficult to identify fraudulent activities from legitimate ones with new technology, so it is important to stay aware and take precautions to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe. Route 65 spoke withSeniors First BCabout increases in frauds and scams during COVID-19, and how seniors can stay safe. Seniors First BC works to prevent elder abuse and to assist and support older adults who are or may be abused, and those whose rights have been violated. What are the most common COVID-19 frauds and scams? According to Seniors First BC, the six most common COVID-19 scams targeting the public are phone calls, text messages, phishing (fraudulent) emails, door-to-door canvassing, fake charities, or websites, and social media and online shopping. What should I do if a scam or fraud is suspected? Seniors First BC recommends not responding back to any attempted communications and always take precautions. Do not answer the door if you are not expecting a visitor or package, ensure you are purchasing from reputable websites, and do your research before shopping online. Do not click on website pop-ups and close the page immediately if one appears on your screen. How can fraudulent activity be identified? Official organizations will not send threats, errors, or warning messages. They will explain a situation in a reasonable and calm manner, will not demand the immediate resolution of a problem or a speedy payment and will never give you a reason to panic unnecessarily. Scammers have ways of making themselves appear extremely legitimate. They may impersonate well-known organizations, taking advantage of official symbols or logos. They may even pretend to be your bank or the police. Seniors First BC recommends keeping calm and reviewing the situation. Ask yourself: how would legitimate organizations behave with their customers or the public? How can I protect myself from scammers? Never give out personal information such as credit card numbers, banking information, passwords or social insurance numbers, unless you have contacted someone for services and verified their identity first. If in doubt, research before providing money or any personal information. Scammers will often tell you not to call family members or the police but to deal only with them. It is important not to listen to this advice. Reach out to a family member, trusted friend, or call your local police department if you are concerned. How do I report fraudulent activity? Suspected frauds and scams can be reported to: – The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre atantifraudcentre.caor 1-888-495-8501– Your local police department by filing a non-emergency report (donotcall 911)– Your local bank/financial institution and credit card company– The National Credit Bureaus to place a fraud alert on your credit reports (Equifax Canada 1-800-465-7166 or TransUnion Canada 1-800-663-9980)– The National Do-Not-Call List atlnnte-dncl.gc.caor 1-866-580-3625 Where can I learn more?

18,https://seniorsfirstbc.ca/news/changes-regarding-reporting-sale-principal-residence/,"October 31st, 2016",Changes regarding reporting sale of principal residence,"The following changes may impact older adults who have perhaps inadvertently changed the nature of the ownership of their principal residence.  This could be the result of transfers to family members, adding family members on title (joint ownership), etc.  Some of these changes in the nature of ownership may result in liability for significant capital gains tax when you sell your home, or in other circumstances.  If the following may apply to you, we recommend seeking professional advice from an accountant or tax lawyer. The Department of Finance released a series of measures on October 3, 2016, aimed at “…protecting the financial security of Canadians, supporting the long-term stability of the housing market and improving the integrity and fairness of the tax system, including ensuring the principal residence exemption is available only in appropriate cases.”  While the measure regarding the principal residence exemption is likely aimed at real estate agents and others who are ‘flipping’ properties and wrongly using the principal residence exemption to avoid paying capital gains tax, it will catch others as well.  There could be significant tax consequences for many older adults who may have inadvertently triggered a capital gain, given the amount of equity (or capital gain) in many residences in the lower mainland. Concurrent with the Department of Finance’s announcement, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) announced significant changes to its administrative position regarding thereporting of principal residence dispositions. Briefly, the CRA states the following: Starting with the 2016 tax year, individuals who sell their principal residence will have to report the sale on Schedule 3,Capital Gainsof theT1Income Tax and Benefit Return. Reporting will be required for sales that occur on or after January 1, 2016. You will complete Schedule 3 and file it with yourT1 Income Tax and Benefit Returnfor the year you sell the property. If the property was your principal residence for every year that you owned it, you will make the principal residence designation in your Schedule 3. In this case, the year of acquisition, proceeds of disposition and the description of the property are the information that will have to be reported. Schedule 3 will be modified accordingly. Form T2091 (or Form T1255) will still be required for the designation in the case the property was not your principal residence for all of the years that you owned it.",

They are expecting a high number of initial claims, given the pent up demand of people who could not afford the previous solution of an application to the BC Supreme Court. The Tribunal describes their process as follows: The Tribunal’s website notes the following benefits and limits to this early intake:","It can pause the limitation period.Many strata claims have a 2 year limitation period. The limitation period acts like a countdown clock, and when this time runs out, you may not be able to bring a claim to the CRT or a court. But, if the CRT accepts your dispute into its early intake process, the limitation period will be ‘paused’ and stop counting down. You can find out more about limitation periodshere. You’ll be ready for CRT resolution.As soon as we’re ready to start moving strata disputes into our facilitation phase, you’ll be ready for this next step toward a resolution. Just making your early intake application might help to clarify the issues and encourage an early resolution by agreement among the parties in your dispute. You’ll help shape the CRT process.Our early intake will help us test our online intake processes to make sure they meet your needs. You might get a chance to show us how you think things should work, which will make the CRT better for everyone. The CRT’s full dispute resolution services won’t be available during early intake. You will be able to start your claim, but this is mainly a testing phase for intake. Many disputes will need to wait until the rest of our processes are ready before they are resolved. We expect this to happen in the fall. Our timeline target of 60 to 90 days won’t apply to the early intake testing. Your ability to go to court may be limited.If you apply for strata dispute resolution with the CRT, you and the other parties will be required to continue in the CRT, rather than going to court instead. If you start, and then decide you would rather go to court instead of waiting for the CRT to fully open, you’ll need to ask the CRT’s permission. If this happens, the CRT would probably agree to it during early intake. Not everything will be online.You’ll be able to use the Solution Explorer for strata disputes and you’ll be able to apply to the CRT using our online system. However, other dispute resolution processes will be done through email, video, telephone or mail, while we continue to build the CRT technology."

June 15th is World Elder Abuse Awareness Day and the 15 members of BC’s Council to Reduce Elder Abuse (CREA) will be wearing something purple to commemorate this day and to shine a light on this important, yet seldom discussed, issue.  “The abuse of older adults – of our grandparents, neighbours, aunts, uncles or older friends – is something people rarely think about, or speak about,” says Martha Jane Lewis, CREA Chair and Executive Director of the BC Centre for Elder Advocacy and Support, “but each year thousands of older British Columbians experience some form of abuse. We receive hundreds of calls every month at the Seniors Abuse and Information Line (1 866 437-1940) from people seeking help,” she says.  Barb MacLean, Executive Director of the Family Caregivers of BC and CREA member agrees. “Some older adults may rely on others to help them with their day-to-day needs, which can lead to situations of abuse. They may be over-medicated, or under-medicated, kept socially isolated, denied access to visitors or friends, or they may be victims of neglect.” Studies show that seniors are most at risk of suffering violence at the hands of a family member or a caregiver.  World Elder Abuse Awareness Day was first observed on June 15th 2006, and since then British Columbia has seen its population of older people steadily increase. Last July, Canada reached a milestone with the number of people aged 65 years and older overtaking the number of children under 15 for the first time in our history; in BC, this milestone occurred in 2011. “As the population ages,” notes Superintendent Mark Fisher, RCMP Officer in Charge and CREA member, “there will be a greater proportion of seniors in our province at risk of elder abuse.”  CREA is protecting seniors by collaborating to strengthen the foundation of existing supports and protection mechanisms. It is raising awareness about this issue and informing British Columbians about the various forms of elder abuse and how to get help.  Last year, CREA provided community capacity building grants of up to $50,000 each to 14 organizations and their partners to undertake actions in BC to reduce elder abuse. These actions include: assessing the impact of elder abuse in the LGBT community; building a strong foundation of awareness and support for the safety of Kwadacha Elders in Northern BC; and developing and delivering a customizable, ‘train-the-trainer’ training module to frontline criminal justice practitioners, victim services workers and community professionals.  “There are different kinds of abuse and neglect,” says Supt. Mark Fisher. Some signs of elder abuse may include: changes in behaviour, depression or agitation (psychological abuse); changes to consumer and banking habits, or to legal documents (financial abuse); bruises or injuries in various stages of healing (physical abuse); inappropriate clothing, being over or under-medicated, or poor personal hygiene (neglect).  “Join CREA Members in wearing purple on June 15th to raise awareness about elder abuse and plan to take action,” urges Sheila Pither, a Council of Senior Citizens’ Organizations (COSCO) representative and CREA member. “One of the ways you can help prevent abuse is to call or visit your parents, and older relatives or friends. We always mean to keep in touch, but time passes and we aren’t there to recognize the signs that an important older person in our life is being abused.”  To find out more, or if someone you know is being abused, call the Seniors Abuse and Information Line (SAIL) 1 866 437-1940, toll free, from anywhere in the province, from 8 am to 8 pm daily, excluding statutory holidays, or in Vancouver: 604 437-1940. SAIL is operated by the BC Centre for Elder Advocacy and Support. For more information, go togov.bc.ca/elderabuse.

Dial-A-Law is a free legal information service.  You used to be able to call them up, and the person on the line would listen to your issue and then play the relevant tape providing you with legal information on that topic.  The Dial-A-Law program had its funding cut, and there are no longer staff answering a phone line.  There is still an automated phone service available, but you will have to work through an ‘automated attendant’ to find the topic and script your are looking for. Lawyers with the Canadian Bar Association are keeping the information up to date and available to the public on the phone, but also online. There are more than 130 topics!  Funding is provided by the Law Foundation of BC.   The scripts for these topics are reviewed and updated as necessary, and the tapes are now available online, as well as over the phone, as MP3 files you can listen to.   The scripts are also available to be read online or printed off from your computer.   The scripts and MP3 files are available in English, Simplified Chinese and Punjabi. The topics cover the following legal areas: Some scripts of particular relevance to older adults are:150What Happens When Your Spouse Dies –Audio176Making a Will and Estate Planning –Audio177What Happens When You Die Without a Will?178Your Duties As Executor –Audio179The Disappointed Beneficiary180Power of Attorney and Representation Agreements –Audio217Applying for a Peace Bond and Filing Assault Charges –Audio270Protection Against Job Discrimination245Your Bank Account –Audio248Co-Signing or Guaranteeing a Loan –Audio255Door-to-Door Sales, Time-Shares and Contracts You Can Cancel –Audio256Shopping by Phone, Mail or the Internet –Audio257Buying Defective Goods –Audio258Receiving Unsatisfactory Services –Audio260Dishonest Business Practices and Schemes –Audio235Freedom of Information & Protection of Privacy –Audio236Human Rights & Discrimination Protection –Audio239Senior Law and Elder Abuse –Audio420Medical Malpractice –Audio421Getting Your Medical Records –Audio423Making a Complaint Against Your Doctor –Audio425Hospitalizing a Mentally Ill Person –Audio426Committeeship –Audio428Adults and Consent to Medical Care –Audio435Choosing a Lawyer –Audio436If You Have a Problem With Your Lawyer –Audio438Lawyers’ Fees –AudioThese scripts have all now been gathered together into a ‘wikibook’ – an electronic online version of a book – with ‘hyperlinks’ to the various sections.  With a wikibook you can easily jump to the various topics.  It is also easy to keep a ‘wikibook’ updated online.   Individual topics in the wikibook can be read and printed out.  The full wikibook can also be downloaded in pdf format, or in ‘EPUB’ format.  Here is a screenshot of the wikibook main page:At this time the wikibook is only available in English.  For Dial-A-Law scripts and recordings in Chinese or Punjabi, you still go to the CBA’s Dial-A-Law webpage here:http://www.cbabc.org/For-the-Public/Dial-A-Law.  The automated phone service is available in English and Chinese.

Paul became a resident at the centre on Dec. 19 2021 after treatment for cancer at Kelowna General Hospital.“They put in a space heater at that time and looked into the problem with the heating system which I believe was ongoing because the pieces for the units in the room were laying on the floor,” said Fanelli.She contacted the Community Care Facilities Licencing department at Interior Health (IH) which is in part responsible for ensuring regulations are met in licensed child care programs and child/youth and adult long-term care facilities.She and other families later received an email that the heating system was fixed prior to a Zoom meeting between families and Spring Valley management on Jan. 13. Fanelli said she had asked management to remove the space heaters before that meeting.“They didn’t remove the space heaters, because the heating was not fixed,” she said.During the meeting, Fanelli asked what was happening with heating in the building and was told the boiler system was not working but the heat had been restored. But that was not the case according to Fanelli and she asked again for it to be fixed.“They said, at that time, there was no money in the budget for the next year to do any repairs for heating and cooling systems in the building.”Fanelli again went back to IH licencing, and also contacted the Patient Care Quality Office (PCQO) at IH. She then reached out to B.C. Seniors’ Advocate Isobel MacKenzie.“I got a nice email back saying thanks but we’ll add you to the list of problems,” she said.Fanelli added the PCQO has since closed her file because they have no ability to enforce it because of current legislation.Capital News contacted Park Place Seniors Living, which owns Spring Valley, and was provided with a written statement by VP Operations, Kathy Nduwayo:”In December 2021, a concern was brought forward to the management of Spring Valley Care Centre regarding a room where the heating system had just failed. During this period, the Okanagan was experiencing record-breaking cold temperatures that impacted many aging buildings across the health care system and Spring Valley Care Centre was not spared. Due to extreme temperatures, the building’s heating system struggled to keep up with demand in an isolated part of the building.The comfort and safety of Spring Valley’s residents are paramount to all members of our staff. In response to this issue, on-site management immediately implemented an interim solution to bring the temperature up to a more comfortable level in the affected part of the building. Heating system improvements are underway.Multiple options have been provided to alleviate any safety concerns in this matter. All involved regulatory stakeholders were immediately informed and brought in to assist. These stakeholders include Patient Care Quality Office, Kelowna Fire Department, Interior Health Authority, and residential care licensing. Each has indicated they are satisfied with the plan to address the heating issue.We wish to assure all residents, families, and the larger community of our commitment to providing a safe environment and quality care to our residents.”Fanelli has also contacted Kelowna-Lake Country MLA, Norm Letnick for help.“We have communicated via my office,” said Letnick. “I won’t get into the details of a private matter with a constituent, but what I can tell you is the issue was recently forwarded to the health minister. We’ll wait to hear the minister’s response to our correspondence.”Fanelli has started apetitionto mandate senior care home maintenance in B.C.“I want them fined, I want them held accountable, I want full disclosure to all people who have a vested interest in the healthcare of their family members.”Read More:Laid-off Campbell River employees face-off with Island Health directorsRead More:Do we now fully comprehend the extent of care home neglect in Canada?@GaryBarnes109gary.barnes@kelownacapnews.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitterand subscribe to our dailyhttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/lack-of-heat-in-husbands-care-home-has-kelowna-woman-demanding-provincial-action/"

More than 13,000 adults aged 50 and over participated in the study from 2008 to 2018.At the first interval, the researchers recorded initial measures of health and wellbeing. They also captured aging satisfaction through participants’ responses to statements like “things keep getting worse as I get older”, “I am as happy now as I was when I was younger” and “The older I get, the more useless I feel”.At the second interval, they assessed aging satisfaction again.Then for the third interval, researchers measured how health and wellbeing outcomes had changed four years after the second measurement of aging satisfaction.Of the 35 outcomes they measured, 27 had improved in association with improved aging satisfaction four years earlier.Some of those outcomes included all-cause mortality, number of chronic conditions, diabetes, stroke, cancer, heart disease, lung disease, arthritis, physical functioning limitations, cognitive impairment, chronic pain and self-rated health.Participants with the highest aging satisfaction showed a 43 per cent reduced risk of all-cause mortality.At the same time, decreased satisfaction with aging from the first to second intervals was linked to worsening health and wellbeing outcomes.“Prior research has looked at how psychological risk factors like depression and stress might adversely influence health and wellbeing outcomes, but we are interested in factors that might positively influence health and wellbeing outcomes,” said Julia Nakamura, a graduate student in UBC’s department of psychology and first author of the study.“With further research, our findings suggest that interventions to increase aging satisfaction might improve the health and wellbeing of our rapidly growing older adult population.”Nakamura added that interventions could come at both the individual and societal levels. She suggests efforts to combat ageism and stereotypes would be a good first step to improve the way people view aging.“If a person thinks aging is destined to be a negative experience, that might become a self-fulfilling prophecy.”READ MORE:UBC research group launches online toolkit to combat stigma around dementiaREAD MORE:Advocates say lengthy COVID isolation for seniors in care may do more harm than good@SchislerColehttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/a-positive-outlook-on-getting-old-could-help-with-aging-b-c-study-says/"

But Hanan Merrill, owner ofNanaimo Hearing Clinic, thinks bright pink, prominent hearing aids might actually change the way our society communicates.“Set aside your knee-jerk response to pink hearing aids, and think about it a little deeper. Many people wear prominent glasses that improve their sight while also making a fashion statement; we’ve all seen people who wear big, bright headphones that cancel noise and act as a status symbol. What if we were proud of our sharper hearing, rather than embarrassed?”Could increased pride in your hearing aids improve your communication?You’ll wear your hearing aids more frequently.You’ll be more assertive in expressing your communication needs.If your hearing aids were bright and prominent, others would know to communicate better with you.“What if your increased pride — and increased ability to communicate — would help others do the same?” Hanan says. “Through conversations about your pink hearing aids, others may begin to change their thinking around the stigma of hearing aids or work harder to accommodate those with reduced hearing.”There are many simple things we can all do to make communication easier: getting a e attention before you begin speaking, moving away from background noise, speaking slowly and clearly without shouting. We can do these things now, but maybe if more people wore pink hearing aids we’d remember to do them more often!Good communication makes good communities“If more people intentionally practiced good communication practices, I think society as a whole might become healthier,” Hanan says.Less stress, isolation and depression due to communication struggles.More deep, valuable conversations, leading to greater understanding between people.A greater appreciation for seniors, who experience hearing loss most frequently but still have a lot to contribute to society.“I’d like to invite people in Nanaimo to consider this idea with me further, and maybe give it a try — and now that I’ve got you thinking, the hearing aids don’t have to be pink, any colour that makes you proud will work!” Hanan says.Nanaimo Hearing Clinicoffers discounts on bright hearing aids, and Hanan will even supply you with some talking points to get the conversation started.

3,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/advocates-say-lengthy-covid-isolation-for-seniors-in-care-may-do-more-harm-than-good/,"Jan 20, 2022",Advocates say lengthy COVID isolation for seniors in care may do more harm than good,"After 10 days of preventive COVID-19 isolation in her room at a Montreal care facility, Joanne Béland’s 84-year-old mother has more difficulty moving and expressing herself.“My mother, she told me, ’I don’t know if I’ll still be able to walk when I’ve finished my 10 days,’” Béland said in a recent interview, adding that her mother now struggles to get out of a chair.“It’s very difficult for them to maintain their mobility when they’re confined in a room for 10 days.”Béland’s mother, Lorraine, lives at the Ressource de la Montagne, an “intermediate” care facility in Montreal, which offers a higher level of care than a seniors residence but less than a traditional long-term care home.Like in other residential care facilities in the province, residents are required to isolate for 10 days if a worker or another resident on their floor tests positive for COVID-19.Béland, who chairs a committee representing residents at her mother’s facility, said she agrees COVID-19-positive residents should isolate. But she says she worries a 10-day isolation period for others on their floor causes more harm than good.Earlier this week, the users committee at the health authority in west-central Montreal, which runs the facility where Béland’s mother lives, sent a letter to Quebec’s health minister and the seniors minister, calling for the isolation period to be shortened. With high vaccination rates in residential care facilities, and evidence that the Omicron variant causes less serious illness, the physical and mental health impacts of the isolation period are too high, the letter said.“The majority of seniors, they’ve already had their third dose of vaccine, they’re well-vaccinated,” Béland said. “It doesn’t make sense to keep them in this condition, to confine them in their rooms for 10 days.”Béland said she doesn’t think residents who may have been exposed to COVID-19 should be free to move anywhere, but she said residents should at least be able to move around their floors — especially if they test negative.Her mother tested negative twice for COVID-19 during her 10-day preventive isolation, Béland said. “After two negative tests, it seems to me we could give them the chance to leave their rooms.”For doctors who work with elderly patients, whether to reduce the preventive isolation period is a difficult question.Dr. Sophie Zhang, co-president of an organization that represents doctors who work in long-term care facilities, said that while Omicron may be less serious than other mutations like Delta, it can lead to severe illness and death, especially among elderly people who are already sick.“The question is, yes, whether preventive measures are worse than the actual infection,” she said in a recent interview. “It’s kind of tough to answer and I think it becomes kind of an ethical question, rather than a scientific question.”Zhang, who oversees 15 long-term care centres in south-central Montreal, said measures like the isolation period may have to be rethought because of the widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the community.At one facility where she works, an outbreak was declared on Dec. 19 and has not yet ended, as new cases continue to be reported among staff members.“Once there’s an outbreak, we put in place a lot of measures — restrictive measures — on visits, on activities, on mobility within the facility,” she said. “So all that is taking a heavy toll on our patients’ quality of life.”For people who are older and sicker, not moving or moving less can cause loss of muscle mass even after a few days, she said. Reducing the isolation period, implementing more aggressive testing and changing the way outbreaks are defined all need to be considered, Zhang added.Dr. Quoc Dinh Nguyen, a geriatrician and epidemiologist at the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal, said that especially in larger facilities, residents can have their 10-day isolation periods reset when new cases are reported on their floors.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });Nguyen said in a recent interview that testing could be used to lift isolation periods sooner. Facilities, he added, could also take into account their specific risk levels and the ability of residents to follow measures. A regional approach may make more sense than a provincewide isolation policy, he added.“We need to worry about the adverse effects of isolation measures,” Nguyen said, adding that he also worries about the impact of relaxing measures too much.“Although I agree that it’s not as severe as it used to be, it’s still severe,” he said about the Omicron variant. “We still need to be careful and we still need to put measures to reduce transmission.”—Jacob Serebrin, The Canadian PressRELATED: B.C.

4,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/new-canadian-care-home-standards-to-emphasize-fact-that-they-are-homes-not-wards/,"Jan 12, 2022","New Canadian care home standards to emphasize fact that they are homes, not wards","The expert spearheading new draft national standards for long-term care says they must strike a difficult balance between residents’ safety and their quality of life.The pandemic devastated long-term care homes across the country as thousands of residents fell ill and died, and laid bare the deficiencies people in the sector have warned about for years.The federal government requested the new standards in the 2020 throne speech, and CSA Group, previously the Canadian Standards Association, is set to release a draft for public feedback in February.They will be based on consultations with experts, stakeholders and interest groups across the country.Those consultations revealed a tension between infection prevention and the social, emotional and mental well-being of residents, said Alex Mihailidis, chair ofthe technical subcommittee developing the new standards.“We are not designing a hospital, we’re not designing an acute care ward,” Mihailidis said in an interview with The Canadian Press.“We are designing people’s homes and for many of them the last home they’re going to live in.”A report on the CSA Group’s consultations showed many of the policies and procedures employed during the pandemic to protect residents from the virus did so at the expense of their mental and social well-being.Infection prevention specialists from the acute care sector were dispatched to long-term care during the pandemic and sometimes requested changes that limited the residents’ quality of life, the report said.In one example, specialists suggested personal items be removed from the rooms to make them easier to clean and disinfect. But residents’ cherished possessions should instead be considered essential, the report stated.Mihailidis said striking that balance as part of a national set of standards has been tough.The CSA Group standards will touch on everything from the heating, ventilation and air cooling systems and plumbing to the use of technology and infection prevention.While the standards are intended to make sure long-term care centres are safe, he said they will be guided by people-centred care, equity, diversity, and inclusion.Some suggestions that came up during the consultations involved kitchens that residents can use themselves, single-occupancy rooms, dementia-friendly design elements, gender-neutral washrooms, and dining rooms that allow for physical distancing.The standards also need to accommodate homes of all sizes and types all over the country, so they will not be overly prescriptive, he said.They are being developed in conjunction with the Health Standards Organization, which will focus more on the care provided in the homes.It’s not clear how the government plans to enforce the standards once they are finalized and published in December, however.In his mandate letter late last year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau instructed Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos to negotiate agreements with provinces and territories to improve the quality and availability of long-term care homes.He also ordered his minister to develop federal legislation to ensure the safety of seniors in long-term care, though the homes fall under provincial jurisdiction.“Really, at the end of the day, we need the buy-in from the provinces and territories,” Mihailidis said.— The Canadian PressRELATED: Loved ones turned away from B.C. senior homes, advocate saysRELATED: Key sectors facing staffing struggles amid escalating pandemicCOVID-19Seniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/new-canadian-care-home-standards-to-emphasize-fact-that-they-are-homes-not-wards/"

10,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/no-euthanasia-in-quebec-care-homes-during-covid-19-expert-tells-coroners-inquest/,"Nov 2, 2021","No ‘euthanasia’ in Quebec care homes during COVID-19, expert tells coroner’s inquest","A coroner’s inquest into deaths in Quebec long-term care homes during the first wave of COVID-19 was dominated Tuesday by debate over whether medicating certain residents to alleviate their suffering amounted to euthanasia.The discussion came a day after a doctor from Montreal’s Jewish General hospital told coroner Géhane Kamel that some of the long-term residents who died of COVID-19 would likely have been saved with oxygen or rehydration treatments.Dr. Vinh-Kim Nguyen testified Monday such treatments weren’t always available in the understaffed and under-equipped long-term care homes, adding that there were “numerous obstacles” preventing doctors from transferring residents to hospital. Instead, Nguyen said the only available treatment in the homes was often respiratory-distress protocols intended for people at end of life, which consisted of a strong cocktail of drugs used to reduce suffering.“These are protocols that lead to death … it was in fact euthanasia,” he testified on Monday.On Tuesday, another witness, Dr. Marjorie Tremblay, insisted the protocols don’t cause death.Tremblay, a palliative care specialist who developed the protocol, said the medication was used to ease suffering. Its effects include “controlling respiratory rhythm,” “managing anxiety,” and controlling and preventing rattling in the lungs, she said. In the case of COVID-19, she added, the medication also helps prevent contagion by reducing coughing.Tremblay said the treatment can be stopped if the patient improves.“We have to stop thinking that morphine kills,” she told the inquiry. “It’s COVID that killed the patients.”The protocol pioneered by Tremblay specifies that there should be continuous evaluation of the patient’s state based on several criteria and under the supervision of a doctor.But on Tuesday, both Kamel and another coroner assisting her, Dr. Jacques Ramsay, questioned whether the directives were always followed to the letter during COVID-19’s first wave.“Your protocol implies a medical presence, which was not always necessarily in place,” Ramsay said, expressing concern that some patients’ symptoms may actually have stemmed from conditions such as dehydration.Because the protocol itself doesn’t cure patients with the virus, it is only supposed to be given to patients who are assigned to a lower level of care after refusing more aggressive treatment.But Kamel pointed out that in a chaotic situation, the usual checks and balances are not always in place.Witnesses have told the inquiry that workers at long-term care homes had called residents’ families to convince them to agree to a lower level of care for their loved ones, often without explaining the consequences of that choice.Kamel said Tuesday that Tremblay’s protocol presumes that families have been properly consulted and the patients’ levels of care have been properly reviewed. But she pointed out that the reality during COVID was that doctors “weren’t present for the most part,” and that families were no longer allowed inside the care homes.Kamel strongly suggested tightening the rules surrounding the use of the protocol.The coroner’s inquest is examining the deaths of elderly and vulnerable people who died in residential settings during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The intent is not to assign blame, but to come up with recommendations to prevent similar tragedies.About half of Quebec’s COVID-19 deaths during the first wave occurred in long-term care homes, and some 92 per cent of people who died between Feb. 25 and July 11, 2020, were 70 and older, according to the province’s public health institute.—Clara Descurninges, The Canadian PressRELATED: ‘Beyond what’s humanly acceptable’: Testimony ends at Quebec long-term care inquestCoronavirusSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/no-euthanasia-in-quebec-care-homes-during-covid-19-expert-tells-coroners-inquest/"

She will next hear recommendations before filing a final report.Lynne McVey, head of the regional health board that took control of Herron on March 30 as COVID-19 cases mounted, testified that authorities did what they could to save lives.Appearing before the inquest for a second time, McVey was questioned Tuesday about why it took so long to realize how many people had died at the private facility.She said the information was only discovered on April 10 after additional verifications. The inquiry has heard that no one appeared to be tabulating deaths at the suburban Montreal facility.McVey told the inquiry she was scared when she learned that at that point there had been 31 deaths, prompting Kamel to interject that there should have been an accounting earlier.“If we had the choice between saving lives and registering deaths, I don’t think you can fault nurses on the ground for going to a bedside rather than registering deaths,” McVey said.She was also questioned about the timing of a 911 call to police, coinciding with a Montreal Gazette report that appeared outlining horrifying conditions at the residence. One day later, provincial officials announced the 31 deaths.Kamel also noted the 911 call came after health authority staff had been on site for two weeks.McVey said perhaps she should have called police earlier, but she acted after several pieces of information came to light, including the 31 deaths and a report about a disorganized pharmacy counter at the residence.“Calling the police isn’t a crime, and it’s a certainly a situation we’d never gone through in our careers,” McVey said. “We found 139 patients with zero staff, it was unthinkable.”McVey also defended a letter sent to Herron management that informed them the regional health authority was assuming management on March 30. When Kamel said the letter left little room for collaboration, McVey described the situation as “desperate times (that) called for extreme measures.”She noted the situation at Herron was different than other residences where the health authority had assisted and owners handed over staff lists and patient files within an hour.Later, asked by the lawyer representing some deceased Herron residents whether she took responsibility, McVey put the blame on the virus. “COVID-19 is the most devious virus I’ve had to deal with in my clinical career,” she told the inquiry. “The virus has a large responsibility in these deaths.”She later told families she was sorry for the deaths, that the objective had been to provide care to residents.“We went there to help, and we would have really wanted to save everybody,” she said. “There are 18 witnesses that came through here and many of them are still very traumatized by not being able to save the lives that we wanted to save during the pandemic.”Earlier Tuesday, Kamel said she was tired of finger-pointing between health authority managers and Herron officials, noting both sides were accountable and responsible for the vulnerable patients under their care.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });The health authority’s deputy director also took the stand for the first time during the inquest.Najia Hachimi-Idrissi testified that the health authority was unable force three doctors assigned to Herron, who were seeing patients through telemedicine as COVID-19 cases mounted, to treat patients on site.She also maintained the health authority could not oblige unionized employees to report for work at Herron, which is why non-unionized managers were the first to arrive at the understaffed facility to help.—Sidhartha Banerjee, The Canadian PressRELATED: Coroner’s inquest begins into Montreal-area care home where dozens died of COVID-19CoronavirusQuebecSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/beyond-whats-humanly-acceptable-testimony-ends-at-quebec-long-term-care-inquest/"

As per established protocols, outside visits, occupational therapy, baths and social activities all were halted, as was even such simple basics as eating with regular dishware and cutlery.She said she filed a complaint with Fraser Health regarding the continuing conditions not to target the facility – “I know they’re doing their best” – but rather as a last resort to shed some light on the impacts and advocate for those affected.She’s also hopeful that her mom’s story will help persuade people who may have been on the fence about getting the vaccine that it is in the best interest of all.“People need to understand what is going on on the inside when we have these outbreaks,” Thain said. “Maybe it would help them get vaccinated or feel like, yeah, we don’t want to have people live like this.”Fraser Health officials said Monday (Oct. 25) that over the course of the past six weeks, there have been a total of 24 positive tests at the site – 16 residents and eight staff – and two deaths.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });Facility owner Gord McNaughton said that every time the outbreak appeared to be ending, a new positive case would restart the two-week quarantine clock. He’s hoping for better news out of tests that were conducted Oct. 25.If those results are all negative, “then we’re free,” he said Monday.Thain said she questioned for weeks why COVID-positive patients in the affected unit couldn’t be separated from those who were negative, to help contain the spread.READ MORE:COVID-19 infection, illness still critical for Northern B.C. hospitalsMcNaughton said he felt the idea had merit, but when he asked Fraser Health – whose guidelines all licenced facilities in this region must follow – if the most recent positive case could be moved to a hospital, the answer was a firm no.“Our hands are tied in terms of decisions we can and can’t make,” McNaughton said. “They’re totally against it.”He wonders if, had the last two positive cases been transferred, “maybe this thing would’ve been over earlier.”Fraser Health has said that the protocols being followed for each outbreak in the region are “best practices” that have been evolved over the course of the pandemic under the guidance of the provincial health officer, and are in place “for the greater good.”“It’s a pandemic, there’s people in the facility that have tested positive,” a spokesperson for the health authority said. “We’re trying to prevent the spread, this is the best way to do it until we’re certain it’s not spreading any more.”Measures implemented by the health authority at the outset to contain and curb spread of the virus, according to a Sept. 14 news release, included supporting staffing levels; restricting social visits; modifying staff and resident movement to minimize exposure; enhanced cleaning; notification of residents, families and staff; and twice-daily screening of staff and residents.Thain said the support has fallen short of meeting the isolated residents’ needs, noting her mother went three weeks without a hair wash before a medical exemption that enabled her to have baths was granted.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });McNaughton agreed the past six weeks have been difficult.“Residents in quarantine is not good,” he said. “The virus is one thing, but the boredom and loneliness is another.”He said the residents’ doors were left open and that staff in full PPE (personal protective equipment) were in and out of the rooms frequently. He noted that Thain’s mother had been taken for some short one-on-one walks, however, inclement weather of recent weeks has stymied that.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });The Fraser Health staffing support was appreciated, McNaughton added, but not enough. Overtime at the residence has been four times what it normally is, and “our staff are exhausted.” He noted that no staff were displaced due to being unvaccinated, however, booster shots for the residents arrived later than expected – delivered in the midst of the outbreak, rather than in August.Thain reiterated that her criticisms are not directed at the facility itself; that her main focus is to advocate for her mom and the other residents.But so far, those efforts have been to no avail. In addition to Fraser Health and Westminster House officials, she’s connected with the office of the seniors’ advocate and Surrey-White Rock MLA Trevor Halford.“It just doesn’t seem like anyone can help,” she said.“It’s heartbreaking that while the Canucks are going to have a full arena tonight (Oct. 26), and yet my mom who’s triple-vaccinated is not able to get out of her room in a nursing home.”tholmes@peacearchnews.comhttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/extended-quarantine-very-grim-for-residents-of-b-c-retirement-residence-daughter/"

And some of the most effective ones are free.“Many people use hearing aids frequently, without even realizing it. Things like ‘huh?’ ‘couldn’t hear you!’ or ‘what was that?’ are all forms of hearing aids,” says Hanan Merrill, a hearing practitioner and owner ofNanaimo Hearing Clinic. “These are phrases we use to try to hear better.”Some of these hearing aid phrases are better than others — miscommunication can be frustrating, and if you say the wrong phrase you may just spread the frustration around. But phrases like ‘would you repeat that, it sounded really interesting,’ ‘I’m going to move a little closer, because I want to hear what you said,’or ‘can we take this conversation outside where it’s quieter?’are a little better.Advocate for your hearing needs“Another hearing aid that’s really important is one I call self advocacy — standing up for hearing loss you might have, and sharing that with the person you’re trying to communicate with,” Hanan says.Self advocacy means explaining the nature of your hearing loss to the people you’re trying to communicate with, and ask them to do a few things to help you hear better.“If they’re open to it, suggest they get your attention before they start speaking, make sure you’re looking at them, and talk a little slower and a little louder to improve communication.”Use more than one hearing aidHanan Merrill has noticed that sometimes people with new hearing aids think that because they’ve spent thousands of dollars on premium technology they no longer need to use the free ones. But he says that’s the moment when free hearing aids are more important than they ever were before.“There’s no replacement for hearing aids that you wear — they make sounds louder and more clear, and they’re critical if you have hearing loss. But free hearing aids that we all have access to are just as important.”As you adjust to the new experience of wearing hearing aids, continue to advocate for your needs: ask people to get your attention before they start talking to you, and try to find a quiet spot for conversations when you can.For more hearing tips, book an appointment with Nanaimo Hearing Clinic by calling 250-585-4100 or visitnanaimohearingclinic.com/contact.

Some have moved from more remote homes in the Gulf Islands, from the Prairies or from Ontario, because they recognize the benefits of a full-service community for the next adventure in their lives.”If you dreamed of travelling or living on a cruise ship in your 60s, luxury independent living on Vancouver Island is an attractive alternative.

She later married there, while Sumiyama remained on the island where they grew up and had her own family.The sisters later recalled their difficult younger days. Growing up, they said they were bullied because of prejudice against children of multiple births in Japan.Busy with their own lives for decades, the sisters rarely met until they turned 70, when they started making pilgrimages together to some of the 88 Shikoku temples and enjoyed being reconnected.Sumiyama and Kodama were 107 years and 300 days old as of Sept 1, breaking the previous record set by famous Japanese sisters Kin Narita and Gin Kanie at 107 years and 175 days, Guinness World Records Ltd. said in a statement.Their families told Guinness that the sisters often joked about outliving the earlier record holders, affectionately known as “Kin-san, Gin-san,” who attained idol-like status in the late 1990s for both their age and humor.About 29% of the population of 125 million in Japan, the world’s fastest aging nation, are 65 years or older, according to the health and welfare ministry.

But hearing aids aren’t the same as a cast on a broken arm. For most people hearing loss is a silent chronic condition that affects the lifestyle gradually.“Just because you have hearing loss doesn’t mean it’s time for hearing aids,” says Hanan Merrill, a hearing practitioner and owner ofNanaimo Hearing Clinic. “The right time to get hearing aids is when you want to hear better — and I mean really want to hear better.”Hearing improvement takes effort and commitment. It’s a bit like going to the gym — the rewards are significant, but only if you change your lifestyle and commit to the process. Just showing up to the gym once isn’t enough to get fit, and just popping hearing aids in your ears for an hour isn’t enough to transform your communication abilities.“Hearing aids aren’t magic, they do take time and effort. They take practice. They need to be maintained and taken care of. Your brain needs to learn how to hear again. Better communication practices need to be used to get the most out of them. In short, you need to be ready to adjust your lifestyle in order to be successful,” Merrill says.Be a part of the conversation againAt this point you might be thinking, “Yes, this is exactly what people have told me. Hearing aids are a pain… so why on earth would I even bother?”“I’m so glad you asked,” Merrill says. “Like any lifestyle improvement, better communication with improved hearing is priceless!”Ask anyone who’s put in the effort to live healthier and they will always confirm that the rewards are worth it.When you put in the time, effort and commitment, hearing aids can be life changing! You’ll feel better connected with friends and family. You’ll stop feeling left out or embarrassed, and start to feel more confident.“You’ll feel less stress because you’re more in-tune with the emotions and sounds of your life,” Merrill says.The amount of hearing loss is not what determines when you’re ready to hear better. It’s the amount of motivation and commitment. So, if timing and motivation are critical to your priceless success, how can you know when the time is right for you?“At Nanaimo Hearing Clinic we have aspecial processthat not only lets you try hearing aids, but also helps you to measure your motivation.

Is there a life milestone that signifies the perfect time to transition? When should you start looking?“The best time to start looking is, quite simply, now! This doesn’t mean you need to move right away, but starting your search early gives you peace of mind. It also saves you and your family from the stress and pressure of making a decision on the fly,” says Kat Theus, Community Relations Manager forBerwick on the Lake.What happens when you delayToo many people put off researching retirement options, but that doesn’t put off the need to move. Eventually, a change in health, a fall or the loss of a spouse makes moving necessary, and rushed. In that moment of stress and emotion, few of us will have the time or energy to properly investigate retirement communities and find a home we love.“Delaying adds pressure to the decision-making process that isn’t necessary,” Kat says.Another thing to keep in mind? If you wait until the last moment, you may not be able to move into the community of your choice.“Some places have wait lists that can be several months long. You’re not obligated to go on their wait lists when you go for a tour, but you’ll still want to have an idea of how long the wait times are.”Research can be fun!Looking at retirement communities can be a fun adventure — take a friend or family member with you to share the excitement and offer an extra set of eyes.“It’s great to have a look at a few different options so that you can compare, and prioritize what really matters to you. You may not even know what you are looking for until you see it,” Kat says.If you’re a reader, a library would be a great plus; maybe you really enjoy exercising, so find out about their programs — do they have a gym, do classes? How often? If outdoor spaces are your thing, make sure you have a look at the grounds — can you have plants on your patio?“There’s lots to learn and many questions to have answered. Sometimes it takes more than one trip to find out everything that you want to know. It’s great to be prepared as well — jot down the things that matter to you, and find out if they can be accommodated.”Start your search early so you can enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing you’ve made the right decision for yourself.

Salter said she wanted to give a voice to people who felt they couldn’t about working and living conditions in the two homes. (SUSAN QUINN/ Alberni Valley News)More than 75 former staff members, supporters, family members and at least one resident protested last week in front of a pair of Port Alberni long-term care facilities pushing for better conditions.Many of the protesters’ signs brought attention to staffing issues at the Fir Park and Echo Village facilities, calling on the Alberni-Clayoquot Continuing Care Society (ACCCS)—which oversees both homes—to take action.Denis Sauve, a former City of Port Alberni appointee to the ACCCS board, said he attended the protest to speak up for staff and clients at both facilities. “We’re being a voice for staff members that are being intimidated and don’t want to come forward,” Sauve said.“It’s been ongoing for a long time. There’s staff shortages that need to be addressed, the workers that are working—the nurses and care aides—are working long hours and that’s one of the grievances put forward. But mostly you’ve got residents, you’ve got your loved ones in there and they haven’t had a bath for a week or two or three and it’s just unheard of. That’s what we’re trying to address, is to get the proper care.”Staff members were not involved in the protest, however, some of them stood across the street to watch the proceedings, including a union member with the Hospital Employees’ Union (HEU). None of them were willing to speak with media.A union spokesperson with the HEU confirmed for another news outlet that more than 100 grievances have been filed by staff members at both Fir Park Village and Echo Village. Sauve said the grievances are one of a number of concerns.“The fact that 100 grievances have been made by the staff, and none of them have been addressed in a timely fashion is not right,” Sauve said. “And staff members here have a collective agreement to be able to deal with these grievances, but they’re being ignored.“Now we have many workers on both sides that are worried to come forward. They don’t want to come forward because they’re worried about retribution.”Mark Chase has lived at Echo Village for 11 years. He rode his electric scooter among the protesters with his own sign proclaiming that he had been threatened with eviction because he spoke out about conditions inside the home.“I’m here to stand up for the staff and residents that can’t speak their piece,” he said. “I’ve been here for 11 years. I’ve seen what it was before, to what it is now. There’s no comparison: it’s just gotten worse and worse. Staff aren’t happy and I’m here for them.“They’re so short-staffed they can’t run properly with what they’ve got.”Kristy Salter organized the Aug. 31 protest after seeing a television news report where people aired their grievances. Salter, an education assistant (EA) with School District 70, said she is not a healthcare worker but she knows several people who work in Fir Park and Echo Village.“After receiving all these private messages from current staff members that are too afraid to speak because they’re worried about repercussions, I decided I would create this event and hopefully gather enough support to make this out in the open for the community,” Salter said.For more news from Vancouver Island and beyond delivered daily into your inbox, pleaseclick here.RELATED: B.C. mandates COVID-19 vaccination for all long-term care, assisted living workersHealthcareIsland HealthPORT ALBERNISeniorsseniors housinggoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-14');gptRefreshSlots.push(14); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-19');gptRefreshSlots.push(19); });https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/supporters-protest-conditions-at-two-port-alberni-care-homes-as-grievances-pile-up/"

In her role as Community Relations Manager forBerwick on the Lake, Kat Theus meets many seniors who are fearful of retirement communities. But she says when it comes to retirement living, arming yourself with knowledge can go a long way to putting your mind at ease.“Many people remember the ‘old folks homes’ or ‘care homes’ of many decades ago – perhaps they had a grandparent or parent that had to move in because there was no one available to look after them. Today, retirement living is a completely different thing, where communities focus on the ‘living’ part. From fun and diverse recreational programming to great, balanced meals and—perhaps most important—enriching social opportunities.”Kat’s tips for touring retirement communitiesSetting up tours of retirement communities in the cities and areas you’d like to live is a great way to dispel fear. Tours come with no obligation, and it takes just a simple phone call to set up.“Take a friend or family member with you as a second set of eyes and to provide an additional opinion,” she says.What you may find helpful is to take a list of the things that matter the most to you. Are you a reader? Then you’d enjoy a library as part of the amenities. A movie buff? Perhaps a theatre is important. How much focus is on healthy aging? What surroundings do you want to live in? What do you require in your suite/apartment?There are no wrong questions and the more answers you receive, the more knowledge you have.“You’ll also find it useful to tour more than one community so that you can make comparisons. Sometimes we’re not even sure what matters to us until we see it. How does it feel when you walk in? How did the other residents seem? Were they happy and engaged? Without even making a conscious effort towards this, you will ‘feel’ it,” Kat says.“Once you’ve toured some communities and received answers to your many questions, I know that many of your concerns will be put to rest. Then, until you are ready to make a move, you’ll have peace of mind knowing where you plan to make your next home. It also helps your family if they are made aware of your wishes—and it puts you in in the driver’s seat of where you WANT to go, rather than someone else making that decision for you when crisis strikes.”Here atBerwick on the Lake, we are always happy and proud to show off our home.

25,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/marketplace/do-hearing-aids-damage-your-ears/,"Aug 23, 2021",Do hearing aids damage your ears?,"“When considering hearing aids, a lot of people wonder if loud sounds will hurt their ears,” says Hanan Merrill, a hearing practitioner and owner ofNanaimo Hearing Clinic.It’s a fair question, considering the basics of how they work. Hearing aids are amplifiers — they make sounds louder — and when they’re sitting deep inside your ear it’s reasonable to worry that they’ll make your ears even worse. But modern hearing aids are much more sophisticated than simple amplifiers.Auto hearing aids have automatic volume control“Auto hearing aids amplify different volumes of input differently,” Hanan says.Soft sounds:When someone nearby is whispering, auto hearing aids will recognize that the sound is very quiet and give it significant amplification. “That’s why, when you first get hearing aids, things like scuffing feet or clothes rubbing sound like sandpaper. You’re not used to hearing them,” Hanan says. Soft sounds get boosted significantly so you can hear them, but the final volume is still within a healthy range.Mid-volume sounds:Mid-volume sounds like voices are amplified a little, but not as much as soft sounds. “Many people with hearing loss can still hear many things, it’s just not clear and crisp. You just need a gentle boost to these mid-volume sounds, to take the effort out of tracking the conversation,” Hanan says.Loud sounds:A jet flying overhead, a jackhammer, a dog barking — most people with hearing loss don’t need any help hearing these loud sounds. “Some hearing aids are even programmed to compress loud sounds, but it’s important that people who wear hearing aids understand that they don’t count as hearing protection.”Hearing aids are not hearing protectionIf you’re mowing the lawn or operating machinery, hearing aids won’t protect your ears from loud noises — even if they’re programmed to compress loud sounds.“If you’re near a sound that’s so loud it hurts your ears, hearing aids aren’t going to make it worse but they aren’t going to protect you either. You should still wear ear plugs or hearing protection for those activities.”Hanan admits there’s one exception where hearing aids may cause damage, but those users understand the risks.“When someone has profound hearing loss and they need a very large volume increase for most sounds, there are super powerful hearing instruments that do have some risk of minor damage. But when you hardly have any hearing to work with anyway, that may be a risk you’re willing to take.”In general, hearing aids are a safe boost to the sounds you’re missing, thanks to automatic volume control.Have other questions about hearing aids?

27,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/lost-seniors-income-supplement-hinged-partly-on-what-agency-handled-their-cerb/,"Aug 11, 2021",Lost seniors’ income supplement hinged partly on what agency handled their CERB,"An internal government document is shining a light on how low-income seniors were abruptly cut off from monthly federal payments based on which bureaucratic body handled their emergency benefits last year.A departmental directive from Service Canada, obtained by The Canadian Press, elaborates on how the Canada Emergency Response Benefit was in fact two programs portrayed as one for simplicity of communication, though they had different criteria.One stream — processed by the Canada Revenue Agency — was for recipients whose income was considered uninsurable, such as self-employed Canadians, while the other stream — delivered by Service Canada — was for those with insurable earnings. The former meant relief benefits would be deducted from low-income seniors’ guaranteed income supplement (GIS), while the latter did not.Pandemic benefits for those in the second camp “can be excluded from their income amount when applying for GIS,” the directive states.Starr Therrien, a 63-year-old Ontario flower shop owner who lost her husband in November and was slated to receive his income supplement, finds herself cut off for the coming year from $8,400 largely due to the CERB she drew on for three months in 2020.“Why wasn’t there a flag when people like me were collecting the CERB?” she asked in an interview.“I know the government was really strapped for time … But there were no warnings saying, ‘These are the implications, you need to be aware of this 12 months from now and how it will affect your life’ — $8,400 is a lot of money, no matter who you are.”Conservative MP Rosemarie Falk said the situation could have been prevented with clearer communication and a more streamlined bureaucratic process, calling the clawbacks “unacceptable.”“Despite meeting the eligibility requirements, these seniors have been arbitrarily penalized based on the stream these funds came through,” Falk wrote in a letter dated Aug. 9. to Seniors Minister Deb Schulte.The $2,000-per-month CERB amounted to “two entirely different relief programs, distributed by different government agencies and with different eligibility criteria,” though seniors were never informed, she said.“Your government must rectify this situation for the sake of the financial stability and security of our most vulnerable.”While the dual-stream complication did not come to light until this week, opposition legislators say they’ve been flooded with calls from Canadians aged 65 and up who suddenly saw their monthly budget tossed out the window amid drastic dips in government supports due to the pandemic benefits they relied on last year.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });Green MP Paul Manly highlighted the “costly ramifications of forcing low-income seniors into greater poverty” in a July 29 letter to Schulte, National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier and Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough.New Democrat MP Daniel Blaikie called last week for a “prompt solution” after many seniors who received the CERB and its successor, the Canada Recovery Benefit, either do not qualify for the income supplement or face drastic deductions to it.Like employment insurance, the guaranteed income supplement is income-tested. That means the previous year’s taxable earnings — including most emergency benefits — factor into how much gets doled out in the next payment period (recipients are notified of their entitlements each July).“This may result in a loss of entitlement if the person’s income (or joint income, where applicable) exceeds the threshold at which GIS benefits are completely phased out,” said Employment and Social Development Canada spokesman Samuelle Carbonneau in an email last week.The split-program wrinkle added another line to a sometimes garbled calculation.“For simplicity of communication to the public, the two programs were communicated as one Canada emergency response benefit. The objective was to ensure that Canadians applying for either income support … were treated in a similar manner,” states a May 12 note in the Canada Gazette, the official record of government decisions.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });As CERB began to roll out, information relayed by CRA call centre agents on self-employment income was “unclear and incorrect,” resulting in improperly stated earnings, the note says.Jack Partridge, 77, said he lost $350 in monthly GIS after drawing on four months’ worth of CERB when his hours were severely cut back at the technical sales centre where he does maintenance and warehousing work.“I was never told,” said the resident of Brantford, Ont.“They say it’s going to all even out in 2021. That may be fine and dandy from their standpoint. But it’s not fine and dandy from my standpoint.”For single seniors, GIS benefits kick in if they make less than $18,984 annually, with a monthly maximum of $936. The eligibility threshold for couples is $45,504.Data on the total number of GIS recipients who had their payments reduced this year is not currently available, Carbonneau said.Seniors continue to receive their full old age security and CPP pensions.—The Canadian PressRELATED: Seniors cut off from federal income supplement after receiving emergency benefitsCoronavirusfederal governmentSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/lost-seniors-income-supplement-hinged-partly-on-what-agency-handled-their-cerb/"

There was nothing about having your pension cut in half for the next two years.”Sherlock is not the only one blindsided.New Democrats say they’ve have been flooded with calls from Canadians aged 65 and up who suddenly find themselves cut off from monthly government payments due to the pandemic benefits they relied on last year.In a letter sent to three Liberal cabinet ministers, NDP MP Daniel Blaikie said many seniors who received the CERB and Canada Recovery Benefit either do not qualify for the guaranteed income supplement or face drastic deductions to it.“They’re just not going to have enough income at the end of the month in order to pay their bills. And what we feared would happen last year will end up happening this year,” Blaikie said in an interview.“It’s not right of us to do this to Canada’s poorest seniors.”Blaikie is calling for a “prompt solution” and hoping that the federal government will change its approach to slashing the guaranteed income supplement based on benefits.“I don’t think it’s a good enough answer to say, ‘Well, this is the way we normally do it, and so that’s the way it’s done,’” he added.“We’ve been making all sorts of exceptions over the past year and a half in recognition of the fact that circumstances are not normal and people are struggling with unprecedented challenges.”Like employment insurance, the guaranteed income supplement (GIS) is income-tested. That means the previous year’s taxable earnings — including emergency benefits — factor into how much gets doled out in the next payment period (recipients are notified of their entitlements each July).“This may result in a loss of entitlement if the person’s income (or joint income, where applicable) exceeds the threshold at which GIS benefits are completely phased out,” said Employment and Social Development Canada spokesman Samuelle Carbonneau in an email.For single seniors, GIS benefits kick in if they make less than $18,984 annually, with a monthly maximum of $936.Data on the total number of GIS recipients who had their payments reduced this year is not currently available, Carbonneau said.Seniors continue to receive their full old age security and CPP pensions, which in Sherlock’s case add up to $783 after the government knocked nearly $500 in GIS off his monthly income. The two pension streams are now his main source of financial support through June 2022, and do not cover his rent and utilities.Sherlock said he put last year’s emergency benefits toward dental work, car repairs and old bills, but he hadn’t budgeted for a smaller income as a consequence of the CERB and its successor, the CRB (he stopped receiving the benefit a few months ago).“I’ve got no money and I can’t pay my rent,” he said.“It’s sort of like if you saw a little old dog in the street, offered it a treat and then hit it on the head with a baseball bat for taking that treat.”Those a decade older than Sherlock have a slightly bigger cushion to fall back on.Starting the week of Aug. 16, the government will provide a one-time payment of $500 to every senior who will be 75 and over by the summer of 2022.And come next summer, the Liberals are also proposing a 10 per cent boost in old age security for those over 75, which the budget estimated would provide an extra $766 in benefits to 3.3 million retirees.—Christopher Reynolds, The Canadian PressRELATED: NDP demands federal wage-subsidy clawbacks, but critics question feasibilityFederal PoliticsSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/seniors-cut-off-from-federal-income-supplement-after-receiving-emergency-benefits/"
29,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/fixing-long-term-care-in-canada-could-cost-13-7b-budget-watchdog-estimates/,"Aug 4, 2021","Fixing long-term care in Canada could cost $13.7B, budget watchdog estimates","Canada’s national budget watchdog says expanding and upgrading the country’s long-term care system would come with a hefty price tag.A report published this morning by parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux estimates ending wait lists, increasing staff pay and benefits, providing more hours of care each day and expanding home care could cost around $13.7 billion.That includes more than $8 billion to add 52,000 new long-term care facility beds, increase private-sector wages 15 per cent and ensure every resident gets about four hours of direct care per day, an increase of almost one hour compared to current averages. It would take another $5.2 billion to ensure spending on home care amounts to no less than 35 per cent of total spending on long-term care.That’s all over and above the $23.7 billion provincial and territorial governments spent on long-term care and home care in 2019-20. Giroux’s report also estimates the funding would have to increase by more than four per cent a year to keep pace with Canada’s aging population and inflationary pressures on wages.The report, based on a motion put forward last March by Green MP Paul Manly, comes as a federal election appears imminent and political pressure is high on Ottawa to help provinces fix a dilapidated system that was ravaged by COVID-19.Bonnie-Jeanne MacDonald, a research director at the National Institute on Aging at Ryerson University, said nobody should be surprised by the size of the figure, but added it’s time for Canadians to have a conversation about “what kind of Canada do we want people to age in.”“Do we want the same fallout we saw happen in the last year to happen again?” she asked.Manly said he thinks Canadians will be watching closely to see what parties offer to do for long-term care in the next election, noting it’s an issue not just for seniors living in care homes now, but also for their families, and for those seniors and older adults looking at their own options for the not-too-distant future.“I think that people clearly want to see things fixed,” he said.The pandemic raced through hundreds of Canada’s long-term care facilities, infecting more than a quarter of the 205,000 residents and killing more than 15,000 of them. That is more than half of Canada’s total COVID-19 death toll.A report from members of the Canadian Armed Forces deployed to help staff care homes in Ontario and Quebec last year listed shocking conditions in some of the hardest hit facilities, including cockroach infestations, poorly paid and trained staff, residents left to sit in soiled clothing for hours, and others sleeping in crowded rooms, with little effort at all at infection control.MacDonald said that report confirmed what those familiar with the system had known for years. But she said the pandemic didn’t just blow the lid off any illusions Canadians had about the standards of care homes for vulnerable seniors, it made most Canadians think they didn’t want to ever live in one.A survey taken by the National Institute on Aging in July 2020 found almost 100 per cent of those asked said they had no interest in going to a long-term care facility, and as many as 70 per cent said that decision was influenced by the pandemic.Federal and provincial governments have flocked to promise billions to fix the problems, and the PBO report does not take those into account in its analysis.But MacDonald said the conversation may need to be more specific about whether adding beds and building more homes is the answer, or if we should be doing far more to help Canadians age at home. There is a time and a place for long-term care homes, such as for people with dementia who can’t safely live independently, she said, but most Canadians would prefer to live out their lives at home.—Mia Rabson, The Canadian PressRELATED: COVID-19 exposed a long-term care system already in crisisHealthSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/fixing-long-term-care-in-canada-could-cost-13-7b-budget-watchdog-estimates/"

Boucher said every senior who was there used to go to the Thursday night dances at the Bowen Park Activity Centre, which sometimes drew upwards of 150 seniors.He hopes to keep holding his ‘Parking Lot Pandemic Party’ dances every two weeks until events can move back indoors.

I didn’t even know her name.”As he played records for the residents over the weeks that followed, the lady with the smile – Christine Connon – moved closer and closer, eventually sitting next to him on his walker.Connon, 80, said “it” happened for her when Wright was handling the music. A six-year resident of White Rock Seniors Village, she hadn’t seen him around until that day in the bistro.“It happened just like that,” she said. “It’s like it was meant to be.”Now, the pair are the talk of the Maple Street seniors’ residence, as they get ready to tie the knot on Saturday (July 31). It will be the first wedding held at the retirement community since it opened as Christina Place in 1999.Wright said word of their engagement just about made community relations manager Si Cussen fall out of her chair. Cussen was the first one to learn the news, but “she couldn’t keep it to herself,” Wright chuckled.In the two months since the proposal – “I couldn’t get down on one knee, because if I got down, I couldn’t get back up,” Wright quipped – Wright said he has noticed a lightness at the residence. More residents are emerging from their rooms, and love has bloomed in other corners.“We think we’ve been a part of it,” he said. “It shows what can happen.”He said the pandemic and all of its restrictions, in a sense, actually increased opportunities to find love.READ MORE:New COVID-19 outbreak at White Rock Seniors Village“The tighter is it, the greater the possibility of people getting close and fond of each other,” Wright explained. “It can happen. We’re as young as we are at heart. We’re getting on in years, all of us.

32,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/one-time-payments-to-seniors-over-75-likely-to-also-go-to-the-dead/,"Jul 27, 2021",One-time payments to seniors over 75 likely to also go to the dead,"Canada’s seniors minister was warned in the spring that the Liberal government’s plan to send $500 payments to pensioners in August would end with some of the money going to people who had died.It’s not unheard of for federal benefits to flow to a person after their death, often as a result of lags in reporting to federal authorities from provinces and territories that are responsible for collecting information about a person’s death.Usually, though, those incorrect payments are followed by uncomfortable collection calls from Service Canada.A late May briefing note to Seniors Minister Deb Schulte said the government wouldn’t seek to recoup the deposits made to the deceased.The briefing note obtained by The Canadian Press said the risks of paying the dead “is very low” and the department won’t reassess eligibility under such circumstances.The note obtained under the Access to Information Act also says that one-time payments will be made to seniors post-mortem if their survivors apply and the deceased met eligibility requirements.Employment and Social Development Canada, which oversees the payments, wouldn’t say how much the almost $1.7 billion budgeted for the measure it estimates could go to dead people.The government has said the payment the week of Aug. 16 is a financial bridge to next year when the old age security payments are permanently increased by 10 per cent for those over 75, which the budget estimated would provide an extra $766 in benefits to 3.3 million retirees.The briefing note to Schulte said the government won’t consider the payments as income when determining eligibility for the guaranteed income supplement that provides extra money for low-income seniors.Schulte was also told officials wouldn’t review any appeals of decisions not to pay out the money, nor would any fines be levied against people who improperly apply for the benefit.The money coming next month mirrors one-time payments made last year when the Liberals decided to send $300 payment to the more than six million people who receive old age security, and $200 more for the 2.2 million who also receive the guaranteed income supplement.Money will flow in August to anyone who turned 75 since June, and reaches that mark by June 30, 2022.The Liberals promised in the 2019 election to bump up old age security payments, which already rise in line with inflation, arguing that older seniors needed additional help covering costs later in life.“Older seniors often need more support and are more at risk of outliving their savings,” reads a recent message from Schulte, sent out on to the department’s stakeholders.“As seniors age, their health and home care costs rise, all while they are more likely to be unable to work, have disabilities or be widowed.”Paying out the permanent increase is no simple technological feat for the federal government. As one document notes, the system delivering the old age security program either has to change or the payments themselves would need to be delivered through an outside system to account for people turning 75.Employment and Social Development Canada, in a written response to questions, said the systems supporting the delivery of old age security are being modified to consider the date of birth of the pensioners and adjust the monthly payment for all seniors when they turn 75 or older starting in July 2022.—Jordan Press, The Canadian PressRELATED: Boost to seniors benefit this summer and beyond could cost $10.7 billionFederal PoliticsSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/one-time-payments-to-seniors-over-75-likely-to-also-go-to-the-dead/"

CROS hearing tech sends sound to ‘your good side’,"Most people are familiar with hearing aids that ‘turn up the volume’ in a slightly damaged ear, but did you know there are also hearing aids to send sound across your head from a bad ear to a good ear?“It’s called CROS technology. It stands for contralateral routing of signal, which is really fun to say because it sounds so high-tech!” says Hanan Merrill, a hearing practitioner and owner ofNanaimo Hearing Clinic. “When you have one ear that’s dead or unusable, but the other ear is fine, CROS can send the sound from one side to the other.”Why use CROSWhen an ear is unusable, you may still be able to hear some loud sounds, but your brain can’t make good sense of them — the sound is blurry, fuzzy or unclear. It serves no practical benefit on its own, and if you put a regular hearing aid in it will only make the sound quality worse. That’s where a CROS hearing aid comes in handy.With CROS you wear hearing aids in both ears. The aid in your dead ear just has a microphone, picking up sounds from that side of your head. It sends that sound to the hearing aid in the good ear via wireless signal.“We have two ears for a reason. If at Tim Hortons talking to a friend, I want to hear what they’re saying! But if they’re sitting beside my unusable ear I’ll have to turn my head to hear them; with CROS you don’t have to do that,” Hanan says. “It’s also really useful when you’re driving, if your unusable ear is directed towards your partner. You don’t have to take your eyes off the road in order to hear them.”Try before you buyCROS technology has its limitations, so it isn’t beneficial for everyone. Having two ears allows our brain to tell where sound is coming from, based on the differences between one side of our head and the other:Time difference: Sound arriving at one ear before the other.Volume difference: Sound being louder on one side, and fading before it reaches the other ear.“Our brain can detect those subtle differences when both ears are healthy, but CROS can only help so much. Healthy ears can also help us filter background noise and focus on the sounds we want, by using those subtle differences in volume and tone,” Hanan says.Nanaimo Hearing Clinic always has CROS demos on hand, so you can test the technology and see if it benefits your life.

And after that, months passed where visits were essentially limited to one person and had to be carefully planned. As well, personal protective equipment was an essential part of the equation and pre-pandemic norms such as hugging were off the table, seemingly indefinitely.Mitchell, who describes herself as “a hugger” and her family as “very, very close,” remembers it was difficult to adjust to life without that physical contact, and, sadly, how it initially felt foreign when restrictions started to ease in April, and those connections were once again within reach.They came after a year of living with the fear of inadvertently exposing Gage – affectionately called “Nan” – to COVID-19, despite following all the rules and taking all the precautions.“Oh my gosh, our first big hug was April 1 – the first time, I want to say, almost since Nash was born,” she said. “It was kind of the most awkward hug, because it had been so long.“It was almost like, oh my gosh, this is happening? Now, it’s second-nature.”This week’s news that fully vaccinated visitors no longer have to schedule visits, wear masks or keep their distance from residents in their rooms is “absolutely” a big deal, Mitchell said. It means Mitchell and her partner can visit Gage together, the entire family can plan dinners and visits and outings, there’s no screening process for visits, and if Gage has plans to go out, “she signs herself out.”READ MORE:B.C. set to relax long-term care visit rules as outbreaks fall to zero“Just being able to celebrate,” Mitchell added. “Us being unmasked and being able to see people’s faces is huge.”That latter piece alone has been interesting with Nash, she added. The tot’s life to date has consisted of interactions with mostly masked individuals, and now she and her partner get to watch as he processes that there’s “a whole other part” to people’s faces.When it comes to her Nan, however, there’s still a hint of fear where COVID is concerned, Mitchell admits.“Our family is still COVID-cautious,” she said, “because she is 95.”“We still wear masks in the car… we’re still quite cautious with that, because that’s our biggest fear, is getting Nan sick, because even a cold for her is worrisome at times.”tholmes@peacearchnews.comhttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/covid-19-restrictions-lifting-at-b-c-seniors-home-absolutely-a-big-deal/"

You did your research, visited the ones you were interested in and made a decision based on what matters most.Now what? You’re probably feeling a little overwhelmed, a little trepidatious, and maybe even some sadness for a chapter ending. But there’s a new chapter beginning that can be wonderful and exciting, filled with new experiences and new friendships.“It’s natural for us to feel a little fearful of the unknown, but making Berwick on the Lake your new home will be a decision that you won’t regret,” says Kat Theus, Community Relations Manager atBerwick on the Lake. “Rest assured that we will work with you to make sure that your transition will be as smooth and seamless as possible.”Berwick on the Lake has put together a checklist to assist you through the transition.Keep in mind that there may be waitlists, so it’s best to check with your new home for approximate timelines. If you sell before you can take possession of your new suite, you may need a Plan B in place. If you’re still in the early stages of planning a move (a year or so away), now is the time to begin your downsize.“Start to give away those items that you no longer need or want, donate clothing, knick-knacks, extra dishes. It’s less overwhelming when you don’t have to do these things last minute and will give you time to really think of what is important to you,” Theus says. “Remember, you can always take photos of everything as a memento to keep. If you require help and family or friends are unavailable, we can suggest downsizing companies to assist you.”Once you’ve chosen a suite:Set up a move-in datewith your mover so you have a goal to work towards. Please note that you will want to ensure that your moving company has a valid WCB Certificate and can provide proof of insurance. “We can recommend a preferred mover who understands Berwick’s policies and protocols.” Once you have a date, it will be easier to set smaller goals such as when to be packed up, when to cancel services, etc. Let your Berwick representative know the date you’ve chosen.Collect boxes and packing supplies(often the mover can provide these). Start to downsize. In most cases, you’ll have to make some decisions as to what to keep and what to give away. If you have family and friends who want items, now is the time to pass them on. “Many charities in town will gratefully accept donations as well — we have a list of charities who can pick up items for your convenience. If you have items you prefer to sell, you may consider online (Facebook Marketplace or Kijiji), or there are auction houses and estate sellers who can help you. If you’d like more information, please ask us,” Theus says.If you’re renting, remember to give your appropriate notice.If you’re selling, you’ll have to coordinate your move-in with the new owner’s possession date. If you’re leaving your home vacated for a time, make sure to let your insurance company know, as there may be some revisions you will have to make to your policy.Bring us at least one set of linens(sheets, pillowcases, towels, kitchen linens) a few days prior to your move so that you have one set ready to go. Other items can be labelled once you arrive.Choose a date with your Berwick representative to do your move-in paperwork.“We’ll provide you a list of what is required for paperwork day.”Transfer cable and internet services.“We can assist with this, and help point you in the right direction of which services to cancel.”Provide a change of address to Canada Post.“If you’d like, we can provide you with Berwick branded postcards that you can fill out for family and friends to let them know of your move. If you address them and return them to us, we’ll post and mail them out for you.”“We will do everything possible to assist you every step of the way.

Tom Moore – in Hillman’s native England – who did 100 laps of his garden and raised nearly $150,000 for charity.Hillman walked 101 laps – his age – in 2020 also raising nearly $150,000.RELATED:Oak Bay 102-year-old veteran to walk 102 laps for Save the ChildrenAfter learning Moore died, attributed to COVID-19, Hillman decided to repeat the event.Heat kept laps limited the first day and Hillman did briefly consider stopping after the death of his wife, Irene, on July 3.

People of all ages and abilities have struggled to enunciate through muffled masks and Plexiglas, and we’ve all spent time guessing at words without the visual cues of facial expressions.For people who wearhearingaids, the ear loops on face masks can cause another challenge.The second you exit the grocery store you reach for your mask to get a breath of fresh air. Without thinking, you flick off your mask’s ear loops and your hearing aid flies off with it. If you’re lucky, you just pick it up and carry on with your day.

Take a little extra care and attention around your ears.Plan Ahead:Think about the best place to remove your mask. Instead of pulling it off in the parking lot, can you wait until you’re in your car? Then if your hearing aid falls out, at least it’s in a confined space. “Some people have opted for different gear, like a mask that wraps around the head instead of using ear loops. They’re not for everybody, but whatever you choose, have a plan.”Protect your investment:“Hearing aids are an investment, and there are ways to insure them against loss or damage,” Hanan says.

It similarly found the specific terms “elder abuse” and “elder neglect” were rarely used in legislation.The paper noted that one of the central issues in defining elder abuse was whether it could only be limited to actions by a person in a position of trust, like a caregiver or relative, or could include acts by strangers as well.“It’s really a barrier for collecting data and collaboration if we’re not all working from the same frame,” Schulte said.The government’s consultations will run until July 22, and next week Schulte and Justice Minister David Lametti are scheduled to hold virtual roundtables on the matter.—The Canadian PressRELATED: How to avoid scams targetting seniorsFederal PoliticsHealthSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/liberal-government-moves-to-define-elder-abuse-to-better-target-ways-to-stop-it/"
44,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/b-c-senior-calls-driving-exams-for-seniors-aged-80-and-up-unfair/,"Jun 1, 2021",B.C. senior calls driving exams for seniors aged 80 and up ‘unfair’,"A Qualicum Beach resident believes B.C. exams for drivers aged 80 and up to be unfair.With Parksville Qualicum Beach having one of the oldest demographics in Canada, Judy Southern, who has been involved with the Qualicum Beach Senior’s Activities Centre for nearly 20 years, said she has heard seniors discuss the “unfairness” of the exams.“One must arrange an appointment with a doctor… if they have a doctor and then pay for it,” said Southern. “Doctors charge, at their discretion. If one is lucky the doctor knows you well and may not feel that you need a follow-up cognitive test or road test.”RoadSafetyBC, the B.C. government’s agency responsible for road safety, mandates persons 80 and above to renew their driver’s licence every two years. They are required to get a medical examination report to be completed by their physicians.The medical report includes checks for cognition, eyesight and overall physical health. Medical Services Plan does not cover the cost of the exam which varies anywhere from $50 and up depending on the physician.RELATED:B.C. takes new approach to testing older driversThose that fail the medical exams, however, may end up having to take the Enhanced Road Assessment to determine whether they are fit to drive. It is free of charge but it takes a 90 minutes to complete and includes a pre-trip vehicle orientation, a 45-minute on-road drive and a post-trip review.RoadSafetyBC indicated a driver cannot pass or fail an enhanced road assessment. It’s just a process to determine the person’s fitness and ability to drive.Southern understands that as people age, some cognitive abilities change. She also agrees that all provinces do require a review of a senior’s driving. However, she claimed that British Columbia has the “least humane” and “most expensive” system of any province.“The road test for seniors is twice as lengthy as for any other age group,” said Southern. “Some seniors who have never had problems driving suffer extreme anxiety at the process – and, sadly, failure is pretty much guaranteed.”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });Jason Watson, communications manager for the Public Safety and Solicitor General Communications Office, indicated that RoadSafetyBC’s goal is to allow people to drive for as long as they safely can.“The primary tool we use to assess driver fitness is the Driver’s Medical Examination Report, which a physician completes,” he said. “Doctors charge a fee for this exam, and they’re entitled to set the amount, which can vary – but Doctors of BC recommends that physicians reduce or waive the fee for patients who are experiencing economic hardship. This has been the approach in British Columbia for at least a decade.”Watson pointed out not all medical information received from the DMER leads to road testing or further action by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles.RoadSafetyBC sends about 70,000 examination reports to drivers 80 and over and statistics every year and data shows that 98 per cent keep their driving privileges.Parksville resident Dennis Belliveau had a business he sold recently that required him to drive to various locations on Vancouver Island. He is 84 and has had to deal with the RoadSafetyBC mandate. But he doesn’t have any problems with the RoadSafetyBC requirements.“I’ve have not encountered any challenges at all,” said Belliveau. “The first step of that process is a medical and I have gone through that on both ocassions and had no problems with that. I get a few questions from my doctor. I drive a lot of miles so I have to be very careful. I do 50,000 kilometres a year.”Belliveau said he reads the ICBC guidelines and driving instruction books to keep himself updated with the latest requirements. He advises other seniors to do it as well.“I want to make sure I am up to speed on all aspects and the reason I pay attention to my driver’s licence, my business depends on me to have a valid licence,” said Belliveau. “If I don’t have one, my business is dead. I can’t go out. So I can’t afford to lose my driver’s licence at least up until a couple of weeks before I sold the company.”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });Belliveau acknowledged there may be some seniors who find the current process difficult. But at this time, he said, he’s had no issues.Southern wants to collect feedback from the public to help raise this matter with the government.“You might not be 80 years old right now but someday you will be,” said Southern.She said there is a plan afoot to gather people on the steps of the Parliament Buildings in Victoria to protest the unfairness to seniors once the COVID-19 pandemic is over.“I replied that I was certain we could add substantial numbers from the (Parksville Qualicum Beach) area,” said Southern.Feedback or concerns can be emailed to Southern atjnsouthern@shaw.ca.Currently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Watson said, RoadSafetyBC temporarily stopped issuing routine age-based DMERs on Dec. 16.“We want to support the ability of medical practitioners to respond to priority medical cases affecting seniors and other during this difficult time.”For more news from Vancouver Island and beyond delivered daily into your inbox, pleaseclick here.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-57');gptRefreshSlots.push(57); });Michael.Briones@pqbnews.comLikeusonFacebookandfollowusonTwitterhttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/b-c-senior-calls-driving-exams-for-seniors-aged-80-and-up-unfair/"

It wishes to ask seniors if they have access to employment and volunteer opportunities, if they are accepted in roles of civic participation, and if they have opportunities for social inclusion. The society is also curious how seniors rate the level of respect they generally receive. As well, Nanaimo Age Friendly Community wants to know if seniors are accessingthe Facebook pageandthe websiteand other seniors directories.The volunteers say they have a lot of objectives they wish to address, and keeping seniors informed and connected is a start.“We try to make sure that things are glued together so that seniors can find who offers what at any particular time,” Page said.Residents 55 and older or their family members or caregivers are asked to contact Nanaimo Age Friendly Society by e-mailingagefriendlynanaimo@gmail.comor calling 250-924-5520.READ ALSO:Society asks for volunteers to help make Nanaimo more age-friendlyREAD ALSO:City of Nanaimo aiming to be an age-friendly communityeditor@nanaimobulletin.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitterCommunitySeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/volunteers-working-on-citys-age-friendly-plan-want-to-hear-from-nanaimos-seniors/"

When hearing aids have poor sound, screeching feedback or feel uncomfortable, it makes sense to think they’re useless. But you don’t have to throw them out or give up.”Hanan says hearing aids aren’t like other technology that you can choose based on look, feel or price. If you buy a new TV, all you have to do is take it home and plug it in and — poof — it will work just like it did in the store. Hearing aids require specialized fitting, time for adjustment, and their function is not universal — the “best” hearing aid is different for everyone.Poor fit“When hearing aids don’t fit properly, it can make someone feel like saying, ‘These hearing aids are pointless!’” Hanan says.Some examples of poor fit include:The wrong tips for your earImproperly tunedPain or pinchingA poor seal that keeps in too much sound, or lets too much sound out, causing squeals and squeaksPoor use“You’d be surprised how many people — even among people who’ve been using hearing aids for a long time — are doing a few key things wrong! It makes the whole experience feel like a waste,” Hanan says.Visit a hearing specialist for advice on proper hearing aid use.Poor expectationsIt can be a tough pill to swallow, but hearing aids can’t fix everything. They are marvellous devices that make a huge difference for many people, improving their quality of life dramatically. But the raw truth remains: they don’t fix the ear.“They can only help the hearing you currently have,” Hanan says. “Having proper expectations about what they can and can’t do for you, and learning strategies to use around your hearing aids to get the most out of them, is also critical to your success.”Better hearing in Nanaimo“I really enjoy the opportunity to help people, when they come in frustrated and don’t know what’s wrong.

There was no one in sight as she lay flat on her face.“I was daydreaming instead of watching my feet,” she said. “I just lay there, glasses mashed against my face, unable to move. Eventually, I was able to turn on my side and then sit up when this young fellow came to my aid. He asked if I was alright, if I wanted him to call 911 and offered to help get me up.“When I managed to get on my knees and hands he knelt and offered his knee for support on which to put one hand so I could push myself up with the other. He said that he was trained in first aid and his quiet assured manner proved that he had learned his skill well.”Magee said he took a first aid course about a year ago. He and other students were at the park during a physical education class playing a game of ‘Capture the Flag.’“I’d just gone in to check if there was somebody hiding in the bushes,” he said. “When I saw her face down in the dirt, it was like ‘oh, gosh.’ I run over and I guess instinct just kicked in.”Bright did not require medical assistance, but suffered bruising on her face, mid-section and leg. Magee stayed with her to ensure she could make it home.“When I was once again on my feet, he continued to assist me, identifying my abrasions and pouring his water over the scrapes on my hand,” Bright indicated. “When I could walk again and felt ready to move towards home, he walked with me for a good part of the way, quietly pointing out the hazards, until he felt that I could safely continue on my own.“Throughout, I could best describe his behaviour as gentle professionalism, far more than I would expected of someone his age.”As a retired secondary school teacher from Ontario, Bright has seen the good in young people far more than the opposite.“I’d say nice students are the majority and the bad apples make it difficult,” she said.Bright did not ask for the student’s name at the time so she made an effort to track him down the day after the incident. She wrote a letter to Chemainus Secondary School and learned Magee was the young man who helped.An informal ceremony was set up outside the school and Bright made the cash presentation to Magee and thanked him publicly again.And what’s he going to do with the money? “Keep it in my wallet till something comes up,” Magee said.“May good karma go with him,” enthused Bright.For more news from Vancouver Island and beyond delivered daily into your inbox, pleaseclick here.RELATED: Good Samaritan climbs B.C. tree to rescue eagle impaled on branchRELATED: Parksville senior on scooter, stuck in snow, gets a tow homeHikingrescueSchoolsSeniorsStudentsNancy Bright displays bruising around her eye.

A hearing practitioner can help you narrow down the brands and models, but first you have to choose a practitioner!Hanan Merrill, a hearing practitioner and owner ofNanaimo HearingClinic, shares the three types of hearing clinics, and the pros and cons of each.1. Big box store clinicsThere’s no doubt it’s convenient to pick up new hearing aids while shopping for groceries or patio furniture, and Hanan says big box stores usually have the cheapest prices, too. But it comes at a cost.“You typically sacrifice service. If you know exactly which brand and model of hearing aid you need, you might do just fine at a big box store. But not everyone adapts to hearing aids quickly, and most people need extra support to achieve satisfying results,” he says.Many people need to try a variety of brands before they find one that feels comfortable, or need coaching and fine-tuning to adapt the sound to their needs. That level of service isn’t always offered at big box stores.2. Chains and Franchises“The biggest advantage of chain hearing clinics is that you can access their services across the country,” Hanan says.When you invest in hearing aids, servicing is often included. So if you think you might move, purchasing from a chain is a smart move. But the selection at chain hearing clinics is often reduced, and you may not get the best advice.“Most franchises are owned or heavily funded by a manufacturer, which means you have less choice, and are strongly encouraged to choose a specific brand. You may get lucky and find a good fit, or you may end up with a brand that doesn’t work for you.”3. Independent hearing clinicsFor strong service, great selection and unbiased advice, independent hearing clinics are usually your best choice. Most aren’t funded by a specific brand or manufacturer, and are locally owned and operated to keep money in your community.“Sure, as the owner of an independent clinic I’m biased, but they generally offer the best service. When you’re spending thousands of dollars to improve your hearing, you want every possible advantage to achieve the best result. Independent clinics offer the widest selection and personalized service to find you the right fit,” Hanan says.Ready to learn more?

In response, the province implemented lockdown protocols for those seniors, to keep them safe and healthy.“This year has been challenging for all of us, but the challenges for those living and working in long-term care and their loved ones have been among the greatest we have faced,” said Henry.“Now that the most vulnerable among us have received a vaccine, we are safely amending restrictions to give people in long-term care greater opportunities to connect with the people they love.”People living and working in long-term care and assisted living were among the very first to receive COVID-19 vaccinations as a part of B.C.’s strategy to use vaccines to protect those most vulnerable to severe illness first and reduce transmission in high-risk settings.RELATED – Staff shortage during B.C.’s deadliest COVID-19 care home outbreak: reportMORE: Canada’s long-term care residents got less medical care in 1st wave of pandemic: reportHave a story tip?

Prior to loosening of COVID-19 visitation restrictions on March 25, access to the long-term dementia care facility had been limited, and the work of Joe Wittkofski, a five-year volunteer at Eden Gardens, has lifted spirits.Wittkofski, who formerly owned a video company in the U.S., has photographed and filmed residents, helping to bridge the gap with their families. He has contributed to Eden Gardens’ fundraising efforts, taking photos for calendars, hanging his works on the walls and working with local quilters to adorn the walls of Eden Gardens with the bright textiles.Sandy Parise, executive assistant at Eden Gardens, said Wittkofski’s work has stimulated residents’ minds at the dementia care facility.“They love it when we share it with them. Their families love it when we share any of those events with the families as well,” said Parise. “Joe’s also done a lot for engagement when the families take their loved ones up the hall. He’s done little picture montages of different scenes that will twig their reminiscent memories as well.”Tony Woods, Eden Gardens’ longtime cook, also said Wittkofski’s “amazing” work is valuable.“It makes a difference in the residents as they can go back and look at these and it makes a big difference for the staff too because we don’t all get to engage in all of these things and see what’s going on … it takes a big thing for a person to volunteer their time to come in make everyone else’s day a little bit brighter,” said Woods.In terms of his feelings about the award, Wittkofski said he was caught off-guard.“I’m more embarrassed than anything because I really feel like what I’m doing here is so insignificant compared to what the people who work here do,” Wittkofski said. “That was my whole rationale for getting involved in this, because when I first came over and you see the love and care that these people [give] 24 hours a day … I thought I should be able to do something here.”Parise said Eden Gardens is currently short of volunteers.

The increase is projected to cost $490.6 billion over the next 10 years.CMA president Dr. Ann Collins says the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed “major cracks in seniors’ care,” adding that improvements beyond “tinkering around the edges” are needed.The study highlights potential solutions that could lower the cost of services, noting a downward trend in the use of long-term care by seniors.The CMA says 37,000 Canadians could be diverted from long-term care by 2031 if that trend is sustained by making better use of home care. The move would result in an estimated savings of $794 million per year.The doctors’ group says it is using its report to press the federal government for new demographic-based annual funding to the provinces and territories to support improving elder care, as well as a pan-Canadian plan to improve elder care in Canada.“It is not hard to imagine what awaits (seniors) in the next decade with no plan in place to address a growing demand for care along with changing expectations for aging at home,” Collins said in a release.ALSO READ:COVID hospitalization costs $23,000 per stay, four times as much as average: CIHIThe Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

(Contributed photo)When Dal Fleischer was 55 years old, he had his life under control, however, a little instability was still desired.So, naturally, he taught himself how to unicycle.Officials with the Canadian Association of Retired Persons contactedPeace Arch Newsthis week to share a recent milestone achieved by Fleischer, who is now 72 years old.Riding on one wheel for about 30 kilometres a day, the White Rock resident recently reached a milestone – he’s logged 40,075 kilometres, a distance equivalent to the circumference of the world.Fleischer belongs to an online group of unicyclists that track their distance using the Strava application, which was initially released in 2009. It’s quite possible the senior completed the milestone once before, but this time he has an official record, which has been reviewed by his peers.SEE ALSO:Unicyclist starts his cross-Canada trip in VancouverFleischer, a lifelong athlete and cyclist, fell in love with the one-wheel bike after teaching himself how to ride. He started small, and eventually graduated to a 36-inch wheel.“I got a bigger one, a bigger one and a bigger one until I got this 36,” Fleischer said. “They don’t make them any bigger because they don’t make people any bigger. You have to be able to reach, from the seat, the pedals’ bottom position.”He has taken his unicycle all over the world, but locally, he said, his favourite places to ride are in South Surrey and White Rock.While you won’t see him climbing up Oxford Street, Fleischer said the one wheel manages quite well on the hilly seaside.“You have to have quite substantial muscle in order to ride the large unicycle,” he said.Part of his motivation are the friendly smiles, waves and cheers from Semiahmoo Peninsula residents while he’s out on a daily trek.“There’s lots of accolades. That’s a motivator, it’s fun,” he said.Some days, of course, he can’t ride his unicycle due to the weather. High wind seems to be among the biggest challenge.“Wind is a problem because headwind is tough slogging and the problem is winds aren’t constant,” he said. “It comes and goes and you can’t see it coming. I’ve had times where it’s just blown me right off the unicycle and I couldn’t get back on.”Now that he’s completed his milestone, Fleischer, who turns 73 this month, has set a new goal that’s out of this world.“Given that I’ve done the equator of the Earth, the next target is the equator of the moon. Simply because I am 73, and some day I’ll have to give up unicycle riding, but it’s not quite on the horizon. So I chose a target that’s doable, it’s only about 10,000, maybe 11,000 km, opposed to 40,000.”aaron.hinks@peacearchnews.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitterSeniorswhite rockgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-14');gptRefreshSlots.push(14); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-19');gptRefreshSlots.push(19); });https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/trending-now/photos-white-rock-senior-completes-40000-km-unicycle-journey/"

The commission is slated to deliver its final report at the end of April.More than a quarter of the country’s long-term care homes are for-profit, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information.READ MORE:NDP announces plan to cancel up to $20K in student loan debt per CanadianThe Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

It’s important to go to a hearing specialist you connect with, so finding out their favourite colour isn’t a bad idea!” he says. “When you pay for hearing aids, about half of what you pay for is the work the person does to make those hearing aids sing for you. That’s why it makes sense to choose someone you trust, who’s easy to talk to, and yes, maybe even likes the same colour as you.”Better hearing takes timeThere are over 10 hearing clinics in Nanaimo and an overwhelming number of hearing aid brands and styles to choose from. If a comfortable fit and excellent audio quality is your top priority, it’s worth finding a specialist who has time and commitment to fine tune your needs.“For all our clients, the first step is getting to know you. We’ll perform a thorough hearing test, and also learn about your lifestyle, needs and expectations,” Hanan says. “There is no ‘best’ hearing aid, just the one that’s best for you, based on your needs.”AtNanaimo HearingClinic, Hanan often visits patients two to five times to make sure they have the right fit. Clients can take more than one kind of hearing aid home to see which one suits them best, and then return to the clinic for fine tuning. Getting the right sound depends on how your ears process audio, and also what you’re hoping to hear.”We also use a special rehabilitation program to help you adapt to hearing a wider range of sounds. It includes communication strategies that dramatically improve your hearing aid experience in many different situations.”Starting to understand why it helps to have a hearing specialist you trust? You’ll be spending a lot of time together! Even after you get the right fit, you’ll likely return to the clinic for adjustments and servicing.“Maintenance checks ensure hearing aids are still working their best. We also offer further adjustments, because it’s common to have changing needs as you adapt to wearing hearing aids,” Hanan says.Ready to learn more?

The company said a study of more than 17 million patients who received the vaccine did not identify any blood clots that were caused by the vaccine, and Thrombosis Canada also issued a statement saying the vaccine was safe.Léger executive vice-president Christian Bourque said concerns about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine don’t seem to be on Canadians’ minds.“For now, there’s no real major issue exactly (with the AstraZeneca vaccine), but could it in light of what we’ve seen over the past couple of days? I don’t know,” Bourque said.The online poll of 1,512 adult Canadians was carried out March 12 to 14 and cannot be assigned a margin of error because internet-based surveys are not considered random samples.The poll also found that 41 per cent of respondents say they believe the worst of the COVID-19 crisis is behind us, while 25 per cent say we are now in the worst period.Bourque said Canadians seem to feel that we’re rounding the corner as vaccination campaigns are accelerate across the country.READ MORE:Trudeau offers reassurance on AstraZeneca safety as European countries suspend useMia Rabson and Maan Alhmidi, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

But now, that guitar, and the connection it revived, has gone missing.Michael Vecchio struggles with dementia. Two years ago, the now-75-year-old asked his daughter Connie Vecchio to bring his prized guitar, which he’d owned for almost 50 years, to his Castlegar care home, Talarico Place.Connie, who lives in Kelowna, did so without hesitation. Michael would pick up the guitar to play during subsequent visits, and Connie said he’d become “himself again.”“He sees the guitar… And then he’d sort of start bobbing his head, and before we know it, we’re in a moment,” Connie said.The last time Connie visited her father in his room was February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic changed visitation protocols. The guitar sat on a stand in the corner of his room beside two amplifiers.Care home staff recently informed Connie they couldn’t find the guitar. Checking a basement storage area, staff located the amps and the stand, but no trace of the guitar.Not knowing what to do, Connie posted her story to Facebook. She said the community response has been immense, with people even offering to give Michael a new guitar. But, “unless it’s a cherry Guild Starfire,” Connie said it just wouldn’t be the same.“That’s the guitar,” she said. “… It’s that thing that brings somebody back.”* VINTAGE GUILD STARFIRE GUITAR MISSING FROM CARE HOME IN CASTLEGAR *RCMP FILE # 2021-719Thank you to the community…Posted byConnie VecchioonThursday, March 11, 2021Michael bought the guitar in the ’70s off of Nick Keraiff — better known as Buddy Marr, the frontman of a popular Kootenay band called the Versatiles. Ever since then, he’s kept the guitar in impeccable shape. Guitars of a similar ilk have been listed in online marketplaces for more than $2,000.Connie has filed a police report and is offering a no-questions-asked $1,000 reward for the guitar’s safe return. Those with information can reach out to Connie on Facebook or the guitar can be dropped off at Johnny’s Gas in Robson, B.C., which is owned by one of Michael’s friends.“I’m so hopeful somebody will just return it to my dad and help him have some happy moments in his last chapter.”READ MORE:COVID vaccination party at North Okanagan retirement communityREAD MORE:COVID-19 vaccine protects health staff, seniors best after three weeksDo you have something to add to this story, or something else we should report on?

Her most recent victory: a fight against COVID-19.At 105, she is believed to be the oldest person to survive the virus in B.C.It’s for this reason her upcoming 105th birthday will serve as an extra-special milestone.The Heritage Square resident will celebrate her birthday on March 16, 2021. Born in Witko, Sask. in 1916, the beginning of Chura’s story predates her move to Vernon by nearly a century.Given that she’s lived through multiple World Wars and other global catastrophes — as well as personal health scares and poverty — her survival of the novel coronavirus is almost unsurprising.Almost, if not for the fact that U.S. Centers for Disease Control data suggests people aged 85 years and up have a fatality rate 7,900 times higher than people from ages five to 17 — and the risk is much higher among centenarians.Seventy people, 47 residents and 23 staff tested positive and nine people died following an outbreak at Heritage Square. Although Chura was also infected, she fought through. The outbreak, which was announced in late December, was declared over mid-February.“She has always been determined to overcome the challenges of her life even as she aged, and she has,” Dorothy’s daughter, Diane, told the Morning Star.Chura’s first major life alteration came at the age of five when her mother passed away,Her father moved to the United States to re-marry. Chura was placed in eight different foster homes before landing in a family whose patriarch would not allow her to go to school, instead sending her to work the farm.Such was life in the Prairies for an orphaned girl, until she got married on Aug. 6, 1938 to Peter (Pat) Chura at the age of 21.As the oldest of five children Peter had been forced to leave medical school to help his mother and siblings, when his own father suddenly died. He later became a teacher — it was a cheaper and easier profession to get into then.Following this, the young couple moved around Saskatchewan. Dorothy took part in local theatre activities, and also took the spotlight.“Reportedly she was a gifted actress,” her daughter says.When they arrived in Toronto in 1942, Dorothy proved herself an “exceptional seamstress” and talented hair stylist, but with her husband’s purchase of confectionery and lunch restaurant, she reinvented herself in the city as a businesswoman. And she was good at that, too.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });“It was hard work with long hours, but they made it thrive,” Diane said. “Dorothy proved to be a natural businesswoman and through her contacts, wheeling, dealing, and great resourcefulness managed always to procure items no other store could find.”One lunch confectionery became two, but in the interest of sparing themselves from extremely long hours, they sold the business — only to go the Empire route.The Churas moved to Hamilton, Ont. and bought the Empire Motel. They had a daughter in 1949, who came to them between two hotel purchases after they relocated to Brantford and bought The Strand, a prohibition-era hotel, which suffered damage from a major fire that levelled several businesses on the block. Pat returned to teaching.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });READ MORE:COVID vaccination party at Armstrong retirement communityREAD MORE:COVID-19 vaccine protects health staff, seniors best after three weeksThe couple had been married almost 50 years when in the late 1980s Pat became sick.

The research to be funded won’t necessarily be pandemic-related.The funding comes on top of some $1 billion the Trudeau government has plowed into research since COVID-19 started sweeping the country a year ago, in a bid to keep researchers working throughout the pandemic on all manner of projects that the government hopes will eventually help the economy rebound.READ MORE:Most B.C. adults could get their first COVID vaccine shot by July: health officialsThe Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

She enlisted the help of Elder Dog Canada.Four times a week, Cowley said, a volunteer from Elder Dog Canada would swing by her place, pick up Kevin, and take him for a walk.It was such a benefit, Cowley said, that she volunteered her services in an outreach capacity to give back to the organization that helped her in a time of need.“It was wonderful,” Cowley said. “I would have been stuck… How would I have walked my dog? I live on my own and he wouldn’t have had any walks while I was (recuperating) and it’s a free service.”Cowley put PAN in touch with Elder Dog’s Christina Saremba.Saremba said the organization has about 300 volunteers at its disposal in the Lower Mainland, but only about 40 clients who use the service.The organization is searching for more clients who can not only make use of its walking services, but some of its other dog-care supports.“The other is transportation,” Saremba said. “Sometimes seniors don’t have a way to get their dog either to the groomer or the vet. So we help with that as well.”Volunteers also offer minor grooming services. For example, Saremba said, they have a client who can walk his dogs, but his knees don’t allow him to brush his golden Labrador.“He needs to be brushed quite frequently. So we have some volunteers go by a couple times a week and brush. We’re talking minor grooming,” Saremba said.RELATED:‘Man’s Best Friend:’ Documentary highlights non-profit that helps seniors with dog careSaremba said the organization will also pick up dog food or supplies and offer some fostering services.“Either the (senior) knows ahead of time they’re going to go to the hospital for, perhaps, surgery. So they would like to arrange for one of our fosters to look after their dog or dogs,” she said.Some seniors, Saremba said, refuse to go to the hospital unless they can find a caregiver for their dog.“More often than not we get calls from hospital social workers or family members that hear about Elder Dog and they have a senior that won’t go to the hospital because someone has to look after their dog. We’ll do that.”On some occasions, Elder Dog will re-home a dog if a senior moves into long-term care or subsidized housing where they can’t keep the pet, or if the senior passes away.“We will look after re-homing,” Saremba said. “We’re not a rescue organization. We’ve got to be clear about that.”Saremba said COVID-19 has led to a significant increase in the number of people willing to volunteer for the organization. Since December, they have received more than 100 applications.“It’s grown exponentially. It’s crazy.”While the number of volunteers drastically outnumbers clients, Saremba said the organization is still accepting applications because some areas still need coverage.An Ontario filmmaker, meanwhile, recently premiered a documentary about the organization.Dwight Storring of Kitchener, Ont. aired ‘Dog’s Best Friend’ on YouTube at the end of January to bring awareness to the efforts made by Elder Dog Canada.Elder Dog was founded in Nova Scotia in 2009 by Dr. Ardra Cole and now operates across the country.The 50-minute film explores “the life-changing stories of five families and their dogs. Viewers will meet an aging Great Dane, an athletic German shorthaired pointer, a wire-haired rescue dog, two French bulldogs, and a bull mastiff as they navigate their changing family circumstances.”For more information about Elder Dog visit www.elderdog.ca or contact 1-855-336-4226 or email info@elderdog.caDogsSeniorsVolunteerhttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/b-c-woman-has-nothing-but-praise-for-elder-dog-canada/"

By the time the outbreak was declared over by Interior Health on Feb. 2, four people were dead while 41 residents and five staff members had been infected.Huby was one of the lucky residents to emerge from her suite healthy.

67,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/planning-for-dropouts-drugmakers-grapple-with-testing-unproven-vaccines-on-seniors/,"Feb 7, 2021",‘Planning for dropouts’: Drugmakers grapple with testing unproven vaccines on seniors,"At age 70, retired nurse Donna Lessard can expect to be towards the front of the line for a COVID-19 vaccine when supply and distribution expands in coming months.But instead, she’s opted for an unproven vaccine candidate she can have now – a two-dose product by the Quebec City-based biopharmaceuticalMedicago currently running Phase 2 clinical trials.Because the trials are blinded, the Montrealer doesn’t know if last month she received a second dose of the prospective vaccine or a placebo, and may not know for a year – well after most Canadians are expected to receive one of several licensed vaccines.Lessard admits her decision could put her at risk of COVID-19 infection much longer than other seniors, but says there are many people who need approved vaccines more urgently than she does.“I’m not in a nursing home, I’m in excellent health,” says Lessard, who was a nurse for 50 years before retiring in 2020. “There are a lot of other people, rightly so, that would go before me.”Despite the willingness of senior trial participants like Lessard, whether and how to include seniors in COVID-19 vaccine trials poses thorny ethical questions now that effective vaccines are available and more are soon to come, says University of Toronto bioethicist Kerry Bowman.Seniors, by far, have been hardest hit by the novel coronavirus, with about 70 per cent of Canada’s COVID-19 deaths involving people aged 80 and older, and nearly 20 per cent between the ages of 70 and 80.The emergence of more infectious variants adds even more uncertainty to the pandemic, especially after one version was linked to a devastating outbreak that engulfed a Barrie, Ont., long-term care facility and killed dozens of residents.“I generally don’t think it’s justifiable right now having senior citizens in completely blinded trials,” says Bowman.“We can’t fully quantify risks, which I think is significant…. The variants are the wild card now. We don’t even know which way this is going and the whole situation could get a lot worse very quickly.”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });Still, there can be exceptions for healthy volunteers such as Lessard, especially if the trial is designed to minimize potential harms, Bowman allows.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });The Medicago trial limits its use of placebos as one way to do that – the company says that for every volunteer who gets a saline injection, five participants receive the proposed vaccine.That’s instead of splitting volunteers equally between the placebo and treatment groups, more typical in double-blinded trials trying to assess how effective a proposed drug really is.Given the risks posed by the ongoing pandemic, infectious disease physician Zain Chagla suggests it would more appropriate to compare vaccine hopefuls to already proven options, which in Canada are by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.It’s hard for researchers to say they’re not causing harm if they effectively deny someone a proven drug, says Chagla, an associate professor of medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton.“Many of these trials will have to eventually have some implementation of a standard-of-care drug, which might be Pfizer,” Chagla says of placebo arms.“And then at the end, make sure that everyone who got the (tested) drug also gets Pfizer,” says Chagla, adding the caveat that there are still uncertainties about what happens when someone takes two different COVID-19 vaccines.All clinical trials undergo multiple ethics and protocol reviews by the drug developer and Health Canada to ensure patient safety remains paramount, says Karri Venn, president of research at LMC Manna Research, which is running multiple trials for various biotechs, including Medicago’s vaccine trial.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });And trials don’t typically start with seniors or other vulnerable groups. Only if Phase 1 establishes safety among healthy adults would studies expand to older volunteers, with later trials adding in adolescents, children and pregnant women.Venn says COVID-19 has added novel complications to scientific research, and suspects it could soon become difficult to recruit and keep seniors committed to clinical trials if they know an approved vaccine is imminent.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });“This is for the first time posing a lot of challenges for the traditional way in how you would do research, to be honest with you,” says Venn, expecting some volunteers sign up planning to quit as soon as they’re eligible for other, approved options.“They may say, ‘I’m going to take (this proposed vaccine) and in nine months I’m going to say, “You know what? Unblind me.”’ … There’s all of that happening, too. It’s a very unusual time.”It’s very rare to unblind a participant partway through a trial, Venn adds, and if it does happen, it’s almost always for a medical or safety reason.But all trials must release any participant who wants to quit, no matter the reason, she says, and their data wouldn’t be included in the final results.Giving seniors a placebo is out of the question for Providence Therapeutics CEO Brad Sorenson, who is planning Phase 2 trials for his COVID-19 vaccine hopeful.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-57');gptRefreshSlots.push(57); });The head of the Calgary-based biotech says his recently launched Phase 1 safety trials include a placebo group, but no seniors. Phase 2 will likely include seniors but no placebos.“We don’t want to include a placebo group for people that are older and at a higher risk. Not when there’s a vaccine that would be available to them,” says Sorenson, musing on a possible workaround.“We can do a comparative study where they get either our vaccine or a Moderna vaccine.”Assuming the trial can get its hands on these approved vaccines – allotments from Moderna and Pfizer are both facing significant distribution delays in Canada.Bowman sympathizes with volunteers who consider unknown protections of a trial vaccine to be better than nothing. He suggests those who consent to the terms of clinical trials do so “under duress.”“Before Christmas, we were told we’d be swimming in vaccines by now, and we’re really, really not,” says Bowman.“People have to protect their own lives and well-being.”READ MORE:Trudeau says government foresaw short-term delays in vaccine deliveries to Canada, planned accordinglyStill, concrete data on how seniors respond to prospective COVID-19 vaccines is crucial, especially with relatively few therapies and so much still uncertain about the disease, says Medicago’s senior director of scientific and medical affairs.“I know it’s a big request, but it’s part of science and that’s how it works and that’s how we make sure the product is good, that the people receiving it are safe,” says Nathalie Charland.“There are constraints related to the trial, we are aware of that, and that’s why we say a big thank you to all those who are involved in our trials.”Charland says Medicago’s Phase 2 trial has already collected the data it needs from hundreds of senior volunteers in Canada and the United States, but recruiting the thousands more needed in Phase 3 will be tougher.Half of the 30,000 participants needed are seniors, and half of all volunteers would get a placebo, she says.“We are already planning for dropouts. We are very conscious that this might – and probably will – happen but Phase 3 is an efficacy trial so we have to go in regions of the world where the virus is circulating a lot,” she says, noting prospective sites include Latin America and Europe.“It will be in countries where there’s not that many vaccines distributed yet. So that should help recruit subjects.”Lessard suspects she got Medicago’s vaccine candidate, citing a slight headache and sore arm after the first dose and another sore arm after the second dose.But she says that was not her primary reason for joining the trial, expressing hope her involvement will serve a greater public good.“There’s a lot of fear around the COVID vaccines and we still hear people saying, ‘Oh, I’m not going to take the vaccine until it’s perfect,’” says Lessard.“And my attitude is: Well, how are we going to get it perfect if nobody volunteers? And if not now, when? It’s got to be done now.”Cassandra Szklarski, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

MLA urged in a statement Tuesday (Jan. 19).A rapid testing strategy is crucial in detecting asymptomatic healthcare workers providing care to populations more susceptible to complications from the virus, Lake added.“With 1.3-million rapid test kits purchased by the federal government currently warehoused in B.C. and ready for use, getting the kits into the hands of seniors’ care providers should be a top priority for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.”READ MORE:One of Canada’s oldest seniors, at 110 years old, gets COVID-19 vaccine at Surrey care homeA localized rapid test pilot, launched in December, saw long-term care providers in five Vancouver facilities tested for COVID-19.As a result, the program identified “multiple asymptomatic COVID-19 positive healthcare staff,” Lake said.Provinces such as Nova Scotia have implemented a COVID-19 antigen rapid test strategy in long-term care environments.During the pandemic, Health Canada purchased nearly 11 million Abbott Panbio antigen tests, distributing them to each province on a per capita basis.“We know that rapid antigen testing two-to-three times per week among care staff that has not been vaccinated can be managed effectively,” Lake said.So far, Fraser Health has completed 151 vaccine clinics for long-term care and assisted living in the health region, as part of first phase in B.C.’s vaccine rollout plan.WATCH:Health-care workers receive COVID vaccine in B.C.https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/covid-rapid-tests-in-long-term-care-key-during-vaccine-rollout-b-c-care-providers/"

Older people with dementia in long-term care are not prisoners,” she added. “The good news is there are some things we can do to help support infection prevention and control while at the same time not isolating seniors exclusively in their rooms.”The novel coronavirus has taken a lethal toll on Canadians living in long-term care homes. More than 3,000 of Ontario’s over 5,000 deaths have been in these facilities, as have more than 600 of British Columbia’s roughly 1,000 fatalities. Overall in Canada, residents of these homes account for 10 per cent of total cases and 72 per cent of deaths.A woman whose grandmother died of COVID-19 in a Vancouver care home has raised the alarm about residents wandering during outbreaks. Parbs Bains said she was on a Zoom call with her sick grandmother when another resident entered the room and began hugging her and kissing her on the forehead, remaining for several minutes before a nurse arrived to usher her out.The care home, Little Mountain Place, is the site of B.C.’s deadliest outbreak in such a facility, with 41 dead. But in all long-term care homes with outbreaks in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, keeping residents with cognitive impairments isolated has been a challenge, said chief medical health officer Dr. Patricia Daly.The health authority advises staff to monitor residents who wander but not to lock them in rooms or restrain them, Daly said.Tamblyn Watts said 80 per cent of residents of long-term care homes in the country have some form of cognitive impairment such as dementia. Keeping them in one room without social engagement, exercise or daily routines has a negative effect, she said.She said more staff, not necessarily with medical training but with dementia training, are needed to compassionately intervene when they see a resident wandering and redirect them to a safe area. Ideally, there would be a separate room where residents could walk to other than their own, Tamblyn Watts added.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });“It does, however, mean that you need to have people on deck to be able to help with that,” she said.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });Quebec announced last year it would hire 10,000 patient attendants to work in care homes and train them over last summer. B.C. and Ontario have also created new jobs in care homes for people without prior experience, but much more hiring needs to be done, Tamblyn Watts said.She also said more infection control, cleaning, testing and now vaccines are needed, in order to prevent COVID-19 from getting inside care homes to begin with.Dr. Roger Wong, clinical professor and vice dean in the University of British Columbia faculty of medicine, said people with dementia need a lot of hands-on care.“Clearly, we always need more staffing,” he said.But he said there are some ways to help residents with cognitive impairments stay in their rooms, including placing a stop sign by the door or hanging a curtain over the doorway. In some secure units, seniors wear wristbands that ring an alarm when they leave, Wong said.It’s also technologically possible, though not common practice, to place GPS trackers in residents’ footwear, he said. Playing a familiar piece of music in their rooms can be comforting and help them remain in that space, Wong added.He said families could plan to speak to their loved ones virtually at times when they are more likely to get confused and wander, often in the late afternoon or evening for Alzheimer’s patients. However, it can be a challenge to ensure that residents understand the people on their screen are their loved ones, he said.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });Jennifer Stewart, manager of advocacy and education for the Alzheimer Society of B.C., acknowledged that virtual visits can be helpful for some and confusing for others.Patients may not be able to understand or retain the information about why they need to be separated from others or be able to follow protocols, such as frequent hand washing, she added.“I think we’re in a really tough spot,” she said. “I don’t think anyone’s found a perfect solution here.”However, Stewart said person-centred care is key: looking at each patient as a unique individual and speaking with their families about how to provide them with safety, comfort and meaning.B.C. seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie said the primary way that the virus is spreading in care homes is from staff to residents, rather than from resident to resident. Staff are in close physical contact with many different patients, she noted, and many residents are not mobile.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });She said, though, that immediately after a single positive case, all residents and employees should be tested and residents should be isolated. Every patient positive for COVID-19 should be kept not only in their room, but as much as possible in a certain section of the home, she said.Daly of Vancouver Coastal Health said care homes in the region do not automatically do mass testing after a single staff member tests positive. She said testing depends on the likelihood the employee transmitted the virus to others in the home as well as the timing of transmission.Mackenzie has also called for frequent, routine testing of staff, which B.C. does not do. Ontario tests staff at least every two weeks and has also deployed some pilot projects for rapid testing.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-57');gptRefreshSlots.push(57); });Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said B.C. considered whether to periodically send staff to a testing site, as is done in Ontario, but that is very “low yield” and challenging to do. As for rapid testing at care homes on a daily basis, that is “not feasible” with the tests that the province has, she said.“Our focus has been instead on making sure we have the resources to ensure staffing, particularly if an outbreak has been identified. When an outbreak is identified, testing is done,” Henry said.The seniors advocate said understaffing is “absolutely” still an issue.“I think there have been additional strains on an already strained staffing system,” Mackenzie said.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-6');gptRefreshSlots.push(6); });She said family members can be designated essential visitors to be the eyes and ears of a loved one within the care home and flag problems for staff. Some residents don’t have family members who are able to play this role but many do, she said.Mackenzie added that even when dementia patients are isolated, they should be receiving physical touch from staff. Care providers should also use gentle persuasion and de-escalation techniques to assuage any anxieties residents are experiencing, she said.“If they’re mobile enough that they’re individually ambulating out of their room in the common areas, they’ve got some capacity. That is not a person in end-stage Alzheimer’s with no capacity to understand anything,” she pointed out.“It’s easy to throw up our hands and say we couldn’t do anything, we can’t isolate these people because they wander. That is not true of every resident or even of most residents. It might be true of some and we know how to manage that.”Laura Dhillon Kane, The Canadian PressCoronavirusSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/care-home-staff-struggle-to-isolate-dementia-patients-during-outbreaks-experts/"

A Vancouver Coastal Health medical health officer determined there was “minimal exposure risk” and was not declaring an outbreak, it said.Instead, the health authority placed the home on “enhanced surveillance,” including heightened monitoring of residents, hypervigilance in screening visitors and stronger infection control practices. Visitors were still welcome and group activities were continuing, the email said.Bains felt certain that this was the beginning of the end for her 89-year-old grandmother.“I was like, ‘This is it.’ I was bawling because I just knew this was going to be it,” Bains recalled.The facility declared an outbreak two days later.It has become the deadliest care home outbreak in British Columbia. Ninety-nine out of 114 residents have been infected and 41 of those have died, including Bains’s grandmother. Seventy staff members also tested positive, but most have recovered.Two families are questioning whether some deaths could have been avoided if the home had taken stronger measures immediately after the first case was identified. They also say that a hard-working but understaffed nursing team struggled to keep residents isolated and care for those who were sick as the virus spread through the facility.During a Zoom call with her grandmother after she contracted COVID-19, Bains said another female resident entered the room and began hugging and kissing the elderly woman on the forehead. After several minutes, a nurse rushed in and ushered the other resident out, she recalled.Bains said that while she didn’t know if the other woman had the virus, it alarmed her that residents were able to wander between rooms without staff immediately noticing.On other occasions, Bains said her grandmother’s oxygen tubes were out of her nose and she would desperately yell for help over the Zoom call. Nurses told her that her grandmother was actually one of the fortunate ones because her room was close to their station, Bains said.Bains said she is “so angry” at the way the outbreak was handled.“Something had to have gone wrong at Little Mountain Place … for this to be so lethal,” she said.Little Mountain Place referred questions to Vancouver Coastal Health, where Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Patricia Daly said the provincewide standard is that outbreaks are not automatically declared when one staff member tests positive.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });The health authority determines whether the employee was in the care home during their infectious period and whether they potentially exposed other staff or residents, for example by not properly using personal protective equipment, she said.If there is no evidence of exposures, the authority places the home on “enhanced surveillance” and monitors for other cases, she said. Some testing may be done, and group activities continue but must always follow a COVID-19 safety plan, she said.Declaring an outbreak every time a single staff member tests positive would be too hard on residents who suffer when they are isolated and their visitors are restricted, Daly said.“We’re trying to find that right balance.”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });Vancouver Coastal Health said there was no mass testing of all residents and staff after the first case was identified. It was only on Nov. 22, after a resident tested positive and the outbreak was declared, that full-facility testing was done, it said.Daly said broad testing is not always necessary because it depends on the risk and timing of potential exposures.At Little Mountain Place, it became clear transmission occurred before the initial case was identified, she said.She said during an outbreak, residents are supposed to stay in their rooms, but it is very challenging for patients with dementia to follow those rules. Staff are advised to monitor residents who wander but not to lock anyone in or restrain them,she said.“Keeping residents with cognitive impairment in their rooms, that has been a common challenge across all facilities in all of our outbreaks,” Daly said.Bains and another relative, Bernadette Cheung, have demanded an investigation of the care home’s response to the virus.Daly said she received a letter from a family member last week and has ordered Vancouver Coastal Health’s licensing team to conduct a review once the outbreak is over.The team will examine whether the home is following regulations under the Community Care and Assisted Living Act and, if not, will require it to develop a plan to address those gaps. In very rare cases, reviews by the team have led to a change in management, Daly said.B.C. Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie said she wants to see routine testing of all staff members at care homes. At Little Mountain Place, all staff and residents should have been tested immediately after the first employee tested positive, she said.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-57');gptRefreshSlots.push(57); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });Screening for symptoms is inadequate because people can be asymptomatic and contagious, she noted.“The fact that more people were infected two days later, if you had tested everybody before then, you’d have caught some people,” she said. “You would have been able to isolate them if they were residents or you would have been able to pull them from the roster if they were staff.”Dr. Bonnie Henry, the provincial public health officer, said Monday the province is “looking at” regular rapid testing of staff in care homes. Ontario started doing rapid testing at long-term care facilities in November.Cheung, whose grandmother died of COVID-19 at Little Mountain Place and has been outspoken about her concerns, said Health Minister Adrian Dix called her on Monday. She said he promised an “intense review” of the outbreak and to follow up again with her about his conversations with the care home and the health authority.The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Though the conversation was light on details, Cheung said she appreciated his empathy.“That gives us hope, at least, that it is a priority for him.”She said she has also received confirmation from Vancouver Coastal Health that her formal complaint against the care home will proceed.Cheung has criticized the care home for not being transparent with families. She wants to know more about why the health authority determined there was “minimal risk” of exposure from the first infected staff member and declined to declare an outbreak on Nov. 20, she said.“Essentially, we’re being kept in the dark and it raises concerns and even suspicions,” she said.ALSO READ:Canada secures 20M more Pfizer vaccine doses; U.S. border closure extended to Feb. 21Laura Dhillon Kane, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

73,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/life/aging-gracefully/,"Jan 1, 2021",Aging Gracefully,"– Words by Kaisha Scofield Photography by Lia CroweWe all know that one of the only certainties in life is that we will get older. Yet, in our society, aging is rarely discussed or prepared for. In fact, a common statement on aging is that it takes most by surprise. Many people feel young but look in the mirror only to see an old person reflected back at them. How did this happen? We are a society obsessed with youth and productivity, and slowing down seems like a luxury we cannot afford. So it is not surprising that the topic of aging is avoided, often until it is too late.The truth is, aging is an inevitable part of living. By accepting the aging process, we are better able to be proactive in how to prepare our body and mind for this very natural transition. By identifying the areas that are most commonly frustrating for more senior populations, we can engage in targeted selfcare to make aging less overwhelming.The most common complaints about aging are health issues associated with degeneration. Loss of muscle and bone health, poor joint health, digestive issues, nutritional deficiencies, hormone imbalance, loss of energy and impaired cognitive abilities are all common health problems the more senior populations deal with. The good news is, with a few simple lifestyle and wellness practices, many of these health issues can be minimized or avoided all together.Use it or lose it. Inactivity is the fastest way to age the body. Too many of us exist in a sedentary state; sitting at a desk for eight hours of the day, driving to and from work and then spending our evenings on the couch. Making solid lifestyle choices that include physical activity is the most effective way to keep the body and mind healthy, long-term. While this isn’t necessarily news to anyone, daily movement is becoming increasingly urgent as kids, teens and adults are spending more time on devices and games and in front of screens and, as a result, physical literacy is failing.Once movement habits are improved, it is important to keep the body happy and well maintained. We all know the feeling of sore and creaking joints. That crackling sound is called crepitus, which seems like a very unsettling yet appropriate name. These creaks, while harmless, are generally a result of degeneration in the bones and connective tissue. This tissue is made up of collagen, the same collagen that your aesthetician tells you to take for glowing skin. Collagen is found in skin, ligaments, cartilage, tendons and bone. The bad news is that it deteriorates as we age. The great news is that it can be replenished. Collagen can be taken orally via supplements, pill or powder or by drinking bone broth. This is is a widely recommended support for joint health and for healthy skin, nails and hair.Aging well depends largely on fuelling the body with a nutrient-dense diet. Vitamin and mineral depletion is a common issue for the aging body because as we get older, the body’s ability to absorb and distribute nutrients can lessen. We typically absorb vitamins and minerals from the food we eat, via the digestive process, but digestive health can decline as we age, through deterioration, poor dietary habits, tissue damage, etc. Natural hormone transitions also occur, which can cause the body to go through fluctuations in appetite and energy levels, making meal preparation frustrating and unenjoyable. It’s a difficult combination of issues that are often ignored.The malabsorption of nutrients can occur for several reasons but the two main causes are a lack of dietary healthy fats and consistent dehydration. Our unfortunate vilification of fat has led to a largely depleted population. Many vitamins and minerals, essential to our body, are fat soluble, meaning that without a proper intake of healthy dietary fats, we are unable to absorb nutrients in our food. Not to mention the essential fatty acids themselves playing a crucial role in cellular, tissue and nerve health, to name a few.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });Alongside healthy fat intake, hydration plays a vital role in absorbing the other vitamins and minerals that are water soluble. One of the easiest ways to increase your energy levels, mood, sleep and digestion is to improve your hydration. More than 50 per cent of the population is consistently dehydrated. Mild dehydration can cause fatigue, nausea, headaches, moodiness, cramping and constipation. Electrolytes in the form of sugar-free powders, tablets or even a small pinch of salt can vastly improve hydration levels in the body.Fluctuating hormones are confusing at the best of times, but in an aging body, they can be especially disruptive. The hormone testosterone, for example, depletes as we age, an issue that can affect both men and women. Occasionally men can experience an age-related, steep decline in testosterone that can lead to many health issues. Often referred to as “male menopause,” symptoms are similar to those experienced in female menopause, such as hot flashes, breast tenderness, mood fluctuations and erectile disfunction. It is just as important for men to monitor hormone health as it is for women.For women, the most obvious hormonal transition is the big M, menopause. There is no way to avoid menopause, but there are steps we can take to prepare for it. Maintaining an active lifestyle is essential. Equally important is fuelling the body with a diet that is focused on nutrient-dense whole foods, including healthy fats and proper hydration. Menopause is never fully predictable but well-balanced and supported hormones will ensure that the process runs as smoothly as possible, perhaps avoiding having to put ice down your shirt to cool a hot flash.Reducing sugar intake is the most important dietary change needed to support hormonal balance and the whole body, at any age. Sugar depletes nutrients and disrupts hormone regulation. Insulin, testosterone and estrogen are affected when sugar intake is elevated. These imbalances can lead to insulin resistance which, among other things, can cause heart disease, some cancers and diabetes. Insulin resistance wreaks havoc on hormonal functions, disrupting digestion, weight, sleep, mood and stress tolerance.There are many unknowns in the aging process and while feelings of uncertainty and apprehension are understandable, avoidance will create a missed opportunity. It is never too early or too late to start preparing your body for the next phase of life, and by incorporating a few preventative measures, you are more likely to create a solid foundation of health and wellness to launch from.The more we learn about aging, the less it is about the end of life and more about the culmination of living. There may be a sense of dread as we creep toward each milestone, but what often follows is a growing sense of relief and freedom. Removing the fear and ignorance surrounding the aging process helps us understand how to support our body as we go through these changes. By paying attention to movement, nutrient density and hormone balance, we can not only ensure that we age on our own terms, but that we do so gracefully.Story courtesy ofBoulevard Magazine, a Black Press Media publicationLike Boulevard Magazine onFacebookand follow them onInstagramFitnessHealthSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/life/aging-gracefully/"
74,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/visit-restrictions-contributed-to-depression-among-care-home-residents-doctor/,"Dec 28, 2020",Visit restrictions contributed to depression among care home residents: doctor,"A plastic barrier sits on a table between Debbie Drew and her father during their visits in the reception area of a long-term care home where the first Canadian died of COVID-19.Nine months later, Drew said visiting restrictions that were initially needed at facilities like the Lynn Valley Care Centre are now causing more harm than good for her dad and other residents who are mostly confined to their rooms.That’s where she fears 96-year-old Graham Drew will die alone.“It’s very hard because he’s getting depressed. He’s sad. He needs the socialization because he’s been a very social person all his life,” Drew said of the man known for his sense of humour and love of singing songs like “Take Me Out to the Ball Game.”The National Institute on Ageing said families in British Columbia are enduring the most restrictive visitation policies compared with long-term care homes anywhere else in the country. The institute has issued guidelines to support the reopening of care homes to family caregivers and visitors, even during outbreaks.Drew said she and her sister and brother regularly visited their father since he moved to the care home three years ago. They decided she would be the so-called designated visitor allowed to enter a common area once a week for 30 minutes though the Plexiglas barrier separating her from her father makes visits challenging because of his hearing loss.Isobel Mackenzie, the advocate for seniors in British Columbia, said the unintended consequences of tightened visiting policies have contributed to a spike in loneliness and depression for residents, as revealed in a survey by her office. About 15,000 residents, families and members of the public participated in the survey this summer.The findings released last month show a seven per cent rate of increase in antipsychotic use, and a three per cent jump in antidepressant use between March and September for residents who have struggled to cope without adequate contact with their family caregivers.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });“What they talked about is: ‘I need more help. I want somebody to help me to the toilet. I want somebody to help me eat. I want somebody who’s going to sit and listen to me,’” Mackenzie said.The lack of an association that represents residents and their families at the 300 care homes in B.C. means they don’t have a voice in policy discussions between the government, care-home operators and unions for staff, she said.Mackenzie has called on the B.C. government to establish a family council association, similar to one in Ontario, that would be included in future consultations on issues affecting residents of long-term care and assisted living facilities.The Health Ministry did not respond directly to an inquiry about whether it would consider the creation of such an association, saying only that it recognizes the important role of family councils that exist at licensed facilities.Not all care homes have councils, and those that do aren’t part of any collective group.Mackenzie said care home operators are arbitrarily deciding who qualifies as an essential or designated visitor, with many facilities allowing only one or the other among regular family caregivers.Dr. Bonnie Henry, the provincial health officer for B.C., said she understands the ongoing challenges families are facing when trying to visit their loved ones during a pandemic that has caused a disproportionate number of deaths among long-term care residents.“We’ve been quite clear on what an essential visitor is and recognize the importance of essential visitors and have been working to ensure that the guidance is applied appropriately and consistently,” she said.Families have the right to appeal any decision to the manager of a facility and to the BC Patient Safety and Quality Council, Henry said.Mackenzie said about 80 per cent of residents had no visits between March and June as care-home operators decided whether they met the criteria for an essential visit.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });“Certainly, as we got into the summer months, we had far more restrictions in B.C. than any of the other provinces.”At the very least, care homes should permit one visitor to see residents in their room, something that is not happening at most facilities, Mackenzie said.“I’ve run a care home. I can’t imagine the nightmare of having to co-ordinate visits in a common area,” she said.READ MORE:Virtual concert series Songs for Seniors to bring families separated by COVID togetherDr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto, said the impact of visitor restrictions on long-term care residents whose family caregivers are a big part of their lives has been lost amid the focus on daily COVID-19 case counts.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });“How many families are we putting in extreme distress and turmoil? How many residents are we actually making suffer even more because of overly excessive kinds of restrictions?”Sinha, who is also director of health policy research at the National Institute on Ageing at Ryerson University in Toronto, said restricted access to visiting, especially in B.C., has not always balanced the risks of COVID-19 infection with the risks of social isolation.The need for that balance is one of the principles in the institute’s guideline, which says all long-term care residents should be given the same access to visitors.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-57');gptRefreshSlots.push(57); });That’s all the more important due to chronic staffing shortages that have been highlighted during the pandemic, Sinha said.“If we do it in certain ways, we should be able to facilitate a lot more visits and a lot higher level of socialization because a lot of older people are literally dying of loneliness, and that’s the biggest travesty of all.”Camille Bains, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

75,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/life/sales-surge-for-arbutus-rv/,"Dec 25, 2020",Sales surge for Arbutus RV,"– Words by Sandra Jones Photography by Lia CroweTo say that the pandemic has been and issue for business is like saying the iceberg was a challenge for the Titanic. There is no question that the economic fallout from COVID-19 has been grim. But amid the coronavirus chaos, some businesses have not only thrived but seen a surge in sales in response to changes in consumer behaviour.For Craig and Rose Little, owners of Arbutus RV, this has been an unprecedented year.“We were enjoying record months in the early part of 2020 and that came crashing to an abrupt halt for about six weeks,” says Craig. “It didn’t stop altogether, but sales dropped by 50 per cent.After that, sales went straight up.”Fortunately, as the largest full-service recreational vehicle dealer network in the province, Arbutus RV was ready to handle the increased volume.“We always like to carry lots of inventory and we were fortunate to have 840 units on hand when the pandemic hit.”Their large inventory has sustained the company as consumers—reluctant to fly, yet still eager to travel—regarded RVs as the ideal self-contained and safe solution. With units running the gamut from high-end luxury coaches to compact trailers, there are options for every lifestyle and every budget.Rose says they’ve seen a lot of changes to RV amenities over the years.“They can be a true home on wheels with residential-sized fridges, outdoor kitchens, TVs, home stereo systems with surround sound and fireplaces. We get a lot of feedback from customers who tell us the RVs are nicer than their permanent home.”One popular option has been the travel trailer.“The 17- to 30-foot travel trailer is especially appealing to the first-time buyer,” notes Craig.“Most people already have a suitable tow vehicle, for at least the smaller units, so you just need to have a hitch and away you go.”And, while those in the boomer generation have long been fans of the RV experience, now millennials are rolling into the market too.“Even before COVID-19, we were seeing a huge interest from young adults who had enjoyed camping as kids with their boomer parents. Now they want to make those same great memories with their own kids.”Whether motivated by the pandemic, nostalgia or a love of the great outdoors, customers have been turning to Arbutus RV for more than 32 years. Craig, who opened his first store in Mill Bay after identifying a gap in the marketplace, has exponentially grown the business, adding six additional sales and service stores, stretching from Sidney to Courtenay.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });“It’s been pretty organic growth,” says Craig. “After Mill Bay opened, we got a call from an operation in Nanaimo. They had been selling mostly park models and horse trailers and having a hard time making a success of it.We ended up taking over that location and shortly afterwards got approached to buy another dealership in Sidney. So suddenly we ended up with three locations, which wasn’t necessarily a well-thought-out plan.”But the couple saw the demand was there and went to work to begin building up the infrastructure, systems and team to support the growth.“With a marketing background, I spearheaded the marketing,” says Rose, “while Craig was in charge of ordering the product and managing the day-to-day business.”As Craig recalls, the early years of growing the company weren’t always easy:“We worked long hours and I remember doing payroll at one location and staying up all night to get payroll done for the next location. It was challenging but fun.”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });Now all-nighters are a thing of the past but the expansion of this going-places company didn’t slow down for long.“There was a bit of a lull in our growth as we made sure the three locations were up and running smoothly,” says Craig. “But then opportunity knocked again.”Rose remembers flying home from Alberta after assessing and ultimately walking away from a business opportunity that didn’t seem like a great fit.“I told Craig that I’d rather open up another dealership on the island instead.”So, when they landed in Comox, Craig had a suggestion.“He said he’d had his eye on some property in Courtenay years ago and that we should drive by and take a look. Turns out that property wasn’t for sale but the one directly across the street was. If that’s not a sign, I don’t know what is,” laughs Rose.Two weeks later, they bought the property and as luck would have it, they ultimately bought the original property that Craig had spotted years ago as a way to expand their lot.The company has since added two more locations—one in Port Alberni and the most recent acquisition this past September in Parksville.“We want to make sure that our customers can buy their RV in their own community and get it serviced close to home as well,” says Craig.Their team has also expanded to keep pace and now includes 150 staff.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-57');gptRefreshSlots.push(57); });“We’ve built an awesome team,” Rose says. “Many of them have been with us for decades.”Employees aren’t the only ones who are a committed part of the Arbutus RV operation.“We were at our Parksville location and one of our customers told me they were delighted to see us at the new location as they had purchased five RVs from us over the years,” says Rose. “It’s also not uncommon to meet people who are the second and even third generations of a family who keep coming back. We love that!”On an island that is seeing significant population growth, the Littles see a clear road ahead.“We’re so blessed to have this natural setting and so many opportunities for adventure in the most marvellous climate in Canada. Even though some people started RVing this year because of the pandemic, I’m pretty sure they’ll get hooked on the lifestyle.”Story courtesy ofBoulevard Magazine, a Black Press Media publicationLike Boulevard Magazine onFacebookand follow them onInstagramBusinessSeniorstravelhttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/life/sales-surge-for-arbutus-rv/"

I guess it’s a lonely season for the elderly every year and this year even more so with the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Conway. “So I was thinking of a way that we could encourage them and I came up with this idea of writing letters.”Conway, with the help of her husband Chris Conway and friend Elizabeth Doell, began writing letters by hand in October. It took them nearly three months to write 330 letters, which have now been distributed to senior residents at Stanford Village, Arrowsmith Lodge, Cokely Manor and Little Mountain Manor.“They’re little Christmas cards and they have a little Christmas message and encouragement including well wishes for the coming year,” said Conway. “We want them to know that they’re loved and remembered this Christmas.”Conway said they purchased the Christmas cards themselves but would have created them if more people were involved. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, they weren’t able to get more friends to come out and join them.“It took too much time writing them that we just didn’t have enough time to make the Christmas cards,” said Conway. “We’ve written quite a lot. We didn’t use a computer. We wanted them all hand-written because we wanted to have a personal touch. We’ve got a list of names and they’re personally addressed.”Conway hopes to do it again next year and would like to personally hand them out to recipients.“It has been a lot of fun and we’ve had a lot of support even before we began handing them out,” said Conway. “We definitely want to do this again and involve more people.

Reports on conditions in the worst-hit homes have revealed appalling examples of neglect, abuse and unsanitary conditions.Residents of long-term care facilities account for more than than 80 per cent of the COVID-19 deaths in Canada.Delivery of health care is a provincial area of responsibility and some premiers, particularly Quebec’s Francois Legault, have strenuously objected to idea of the federal government setting national standards for long-term care facilities or setting any conditions on funding provided for health care.The premiers have unanimously demanded that Ottawa immediately increase its annual, unconditional health transfers to provinces and territories by at least $28 billion a year, money that is sent with no strings attached.“I don’t see what the federal government knows about nursing homes,” Legault said last week after Trudeau failed to acquiesce to the premiers’ demand during a daylong, first ministers’ video conference.“If he wants to help with nursing homes and hospitals, he has to boost recurring funding.”Legault’s views have been echoed by other premiers, including Ontario’s Doug Ford and Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe. But premiers in the Atlantic provinces been more open to the idea of federal funding specifically tied to improving conditions in long-term care homes.In the interview Wednesday, Trudeau appeared to signal that his government will negotiate separately with each province and territory that is willing to accept additional, targeted funding for long-term care — much as it did to target funding for mental health and home care a few years ago.“The approach we have as a federal government is to first start looking at what the best practices are in certain jurisdictions that do have stronger standards than others,” he said.“And work with the jurisdictions who want to, to increase their standards to the best possible level. And the federal government to be there to help them with the extra costs involved in getting up to that level … So we will happily partner and work with the provinces as we have during this pandemic.”Trudeau acknowledged that long-term care is a provincial jurisdiction. But he said: “The dignity of elders, the safety of seniors, doesn’t really have much of a jurisdiction. Not when you talk about their lives.”He noted that the federal government sent the military and Canadian Red Cross to help in overwhelmed long-term care facilities in Ontario and Quebec last spring, at the request of those provinces.“I guess, theoretically we could have said, ‘No, it’s your area, you deal with it.’ No. The federal government is going to be there to look out for every single Canadian and that means, yes, working with the premiers.”Trudeau said standards in long-term care vary across the country and from facility to facility within provinces.“And I don’t think that’s right. I think every senior in this country, regardless of where they live, should feel confident that if they go into the long-term care centre that they get accepted in, down the street or across the road or on the other side of town, they don’t have to worry that ‘Oh, maybe that’s one of the bad ones’ or ‘Maybe I’m lucky enough to have gotten into one of the good ones,”’ he said.“There needs to be a sense that in this country we ensure that every single senior gets to age in dignity and in safety and we’re not there.”Joan Bryden, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism?

79,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/first-pfizer-vaccine-shots-to-be-given-right-at-delivery-sites-not-ltc-homes-tam/,"Dec 8, 2020","First Pfizer vaccine shots to be given right at delivery sites, not LTC homes: Tam","Canada’s chief public health officer says the first doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine are likely to be given only to people who can physically be at one of the 14 delivery sites identified by provincial governments for the first arrivals of the vaccine.Dr. Theresa Tam said at a briefing that it is a “rapidly evolving situation” but acknowledged that this will make it difficult to get long-term care residents vaccinated first.“It’s true you cannot move residents very easily from a long-term care centre to a vaccine site,” she said. “That’s just the reality.”It is not clear how this jibes with some provincial plans, including in Quebec, where the health minister said Monday the government intends to ship its first vaccine doses to two long-term care homes.The Pfizer vaccine, being produced in partnership with Germany’s BioNTech, is in the final stages of review by Health Canada, which is expected to issue a decision this week. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday if the approval comes as expected, Canada will receive the first doses next week, and 249,000 doses by the end of the month.READ MORE:Canada to get 249,000 doses of Pfizer vaccine in December, Trudeau saysPfizer Canada spokeswoman Christina Antoniou told The Canadian Press that the company is asking for those doses at first to only be given at the first 14 delivery sites.She said where the vaccine can be injected is “part of ongoing discussions” with provincial governments, who are in charge of getting the vaccine into patients. However she noted Pfizer’s actual contract for the COVID-19 vaccine is with the federal government.“Pfizer, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the provinces are working together to finalize preparations at the first point of use sites this week, including training on how to handle the product,” she said. “These are the sites identified by the federal government’s National Operations Centre for initial vaccination of priority populations.”Tam said she is hopeful that as everyone involved gets more experienced and comfortable transporting and administering the vaccine, things could change.Pfizer’s vaccine is extremely delicate and must be stored at temperatures below -70 C, until shortly before it is administered. It can be stored in a refrigerator for up to five days, and at room temperature for up to two hours, before it is diluted and then injected.The ultralow temperature has made the entire delivery process much more complicated for Pfizer than what is being planned for other vaccines yet to come. While other vaccines will be sent by their manufacturers to one national site and then distributed within Canada, Pfizer is shipping its first vaccine doses to 14 sites designated by the provinces.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });There are two sites each in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta, and one in each of the other six provinces. Eventually the plan is to have 205 sites in the provinces.The Pfizer vaccine is also too touchy to be shipped north to remote Indigenous communities. That means two of the four priority groups identified for initial vaccines aren’t likely to get access to the first rounds of vaccinations.The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended last week that the first doses go to residents of long-term care and their caregivers, front-line health workers, people over the age of 80 and adults in Indigenous communities where an outbreak would be harder to manage.Most provinces are following those recommendations almost exactly.The United Kingdom began vaccinating people with the Pfizer shots Tuesday, after last week being the first country to approve the vaccine.Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc said an expected executive order from U.S. President Donald Trump to prioritize Pfizer doses for Americans should not affect Canada’s expected deliveries.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });READ MORE:Trump, 0 for 2 on tapping Canada’s health resources, may try again with COVID vaccineLeBlanc says concerns about dose supplies were contemplated when the contracts were signed to ensure supplies could come from more than one location.Canada’s first doses of Pfizer’s vaccine are to come from lots produced at the company’s plant in Belgium.Tam says the exciting news about the vaccine is welcome but warns it will be a while before enough doses are injected to control the COVID-19 pandemic.She said there are now more than 71,000 active cases of COVID-19 nationally, and an average of 92 people are dying of the illness every day. Hospitals in many provinces are feeling the pandemic’s pressure, with more than 2,680 people being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals, almost one-fifth of those in critical care.Quebec Premier François Legault warned there may be more lockdown measures coming in that province as hospitalizations continued to rise, hitting 835 Tuesday, up by almost 100 patients compared to a week ago.Nunavut provided a bright spot of news in the pandemic fight Tuesday, with chief public health officer Dr. Michael Patterson noting a milestone had occurred in the territory’s recovery from its first outbreak.Last month Patterson warned the limited health capacity in Nunavut couldn’t handle much more as four communities struggled with cases. On Tuesday he said three of those four were back to zero cases.

80,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/doctors-concerned-about-rise-in-dangerous-medications-in-ltc-homes-during-pandemic/,"Dec 3, 2020",Doctors concerned about rise in dangerous medications in LTC homes during pandemic,"The first wave of COVID-19 triggered an increase in psychiatric drug prescriptions in long-term care homes, new data shows, and geriatrics experts warn this puts patients with dementia at risk for further harm from falls, stroke and sedation.Faced with staff shortages and lockdowns that restrict caregiver visits, nursing homes increasingly fall back on medications to regulate behaviour and manage mental health concerns, says Toronto geriatrician Dr. Nathan Stall.Prescriptions of antipsychotics, antidepressants, sleeping medications and benzodiazepines all increased between March and September, according to a study of Ontario’s 623 licensed nursing homes.This is an abrupt reversal after years of declining use of sedative medications in seniors, says Stall, who led the study.Overall, an “additional 1,000 residents are being prescribed antipsychotics who were not on the medication before the pandemic,” Stall says. The jump occurred following restrictions on visitors and congregate activities such as dining and recreational groups.Such “knee-jerk reactions to try and medicate the distress of residents in nursing homes” during the COVID-19 pandemic are a serious concern, Stall said.He warns that antipsychotics come with a “black-box warning” for the elderly. Stall says they increase the “risk of stroke, falls and all-cause mortality, and are not recommended for frail, older adults,” such as those with dementia, who make up about 70 per cent of nursing-home residents in Ontario.The preliminary figures from the Ontario study were released Monday on medRxiv (pronounced “med archive”), an online preprint server for medical research.The findings, which have not yet been peer-reviewed, are in line with growing evidence that during the global pandemic, rising numbers of nursing home residents have received sedative medications, such as antipsychotics.It could take weeks or months for the findings to be peer-reviewed, but Stall believes it is important to get this information out now in the midst of a second wave.According to a November report in the medical journal The Lancet, a greater proportion of people with dementia in the United Kingdom have been prescribed antipsychotic medication during the pandemic than in previous years.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });And in British Columbia, a survey of nursing home residents and their families by the province’s seniors advocate published last month found a seven per cent rate of increase in antipsychotic use, and a three per cent rate of increase in antidepressant use during the time of visitor restrictions for COVID.“This rate of increase is significant and is one indicator of the potential unintended consequences of the visitor restriction policies,” the report states.READ MORE:B.C.’s largest COVID-19 care-home outbreak records 19 deaths, 147 casesIn Quebec, Nouha Ben Gaied, director of research and development for the Federation of Quebec Alzheimer Societies, says over the last two years, more than 100 nursing homes have taken part in a provincial initiative that promotes non-pharmacological strategies for patients with dementia and reducing antipsychotics. The pandemic halted the program.With “a very heavy heart,” her colleagues turned to chemical and physical restraints to enforce infection-control measures in Quebec’s hard-hit nursing homes, Ben Gaied said. “This is not something that they wanted to do, but this was the only solution they had.”Staff reported that not only were physical barriers put up to keep people confined to their rooms, but medications such as antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and other sleeping medications have been used to sedate and restrict the movement of people with dementia in units affected by COVID with the goal of protecting residents from harm.Such measures fail to uphold a person’s dignity, and she says the stigma of dementia can lead to a curtailing of their rights. Care providers in nursing homes often “forget about the rights of people with dementia, but we should empower (residents) instead of saying ‘you don’t have the right to do certain things’ … or ‘this is to protect you.’”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });Geriatrics experts are concerned that the global pandemic is undoing years of hard-won progress in reducing the use of potentially dangerous and ineffective medications in the elderly and those with dementia.Stall also sees these trends as indicators of something even more sinister: the pandemic response may have resulted in more mood disorders and behavioural disturbances for people with dementia.Dr. Fred Mather, president of Ontario Long Term Care Clinicians and the medical director at Sunnyside Home in Kitchener, Ont., explains that unfortunately, not only are medications such as antipsychotics associated with significant side-effects, but they have also been proven ineffective in treating responsive behaviours in dementia.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });He characterizes “responsive behaviours” as distressing behaviours, such as hitting or grabbing, exhibited by people with dementia that put themselves or others at risk. The current understanding of these behaviours is that they are not symptoms of dementia, Mather says, but rather, “a form of communication that needs to be addressed about an unmet need.”And unmet needs, such as confusion, loneliness or boredom – which Stall has seen worsen under strict visitor restrictions and social isolation in Ontario’s nursing homes – are not best treated with medication.Geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Andrea Iaboni, who practises at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute and in several nursing homes, notes that “there’s no such thing as a medication that will make someone stay in their room – there’s no pill for that.”“If you don’t have the capacity to remember that there’s a pandemic, or don’t have insight into the fact that you might be at risk or that people around you are at risk (of COVID), it becomes very hard to adhere to (infection control) measures,” Iaboni says of people living with dementia and cognitive impairment.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-57');gptRefreshSlots.push(57); });She has helped create a social isolation toolkit for long-term care providers to plan for how to best protect residents from the novel coronavirus while preserving a quality of life.Iaboni says that if medications are used, they need to be monitored very closely, as residents on antipsychotics are “going to be more sleepy or more confused, maybe more unsteady in their gait and more at risk of an adverse event,” such as a fall.While she hasn’t seen evidence of widespread use of antipsychotics as chemical restraints, Iaboni says she’s getting more referrals for “mental health problems such as depression and even psychotic depression, or the development of delirium or psychosis.”Iaboni described how isolation requirements for residents exposed to or infected with the virus “are kind of like putting them in solitary confinement and under those circumstances, people start to hallucinate, they start to develop delusions” – which would be an appropriate indication to prescribe an antipsychotic.Stall says the rising prescription rates found in his research reflect what family caregivers have been telling him and what he has been seeing in his own clinical work: high levels of distress among residents who have been isolated and separated from essential care providers and loved ones.He says a new approach is needed to address the social and mental-health needs of long-term care home residents.“I think about my grandmother, about going for a walk around the block. And leaving the residence and going to her children’s house to have dinner inside their home. And, you know, we should be able to create more nuanced policies that have a little more balance, that maintain the dignity and well-being of older adults.”—Kaleigh Alkenbrack is a family physician and psychotherapist in St. Catharines, Ont., and a fellow in Global Journalism at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health.Kaleigh Alkenbrack, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

(File photo)Helen Watson’s family had this book made to commemorate her 100th birthday. Watson turned 105 on Nov. 21, 2020. (Aaron Hinks photo)When Helen Watson’s birthday rolled around last Saturday (Nov. 21), she couldn’t party like she was 100 – as she did five years ago, when she actually turned 100 – but the South Surrey senior wasn’t complaining.READ MORE:Milestone birthday ‘a whirl’ for South Surrey senior“It was very nice, everybody was so good to me,” Watson told Peace Arch News Monday (Nov. 23) of her 105th birthday celebration.“It was just fine the way it was.”The COVID-19 pandemic firmly quashed any plans that may have otherwise been made to celebrate the occasion in the fashion it deserves.Pandemic protocols months ago changed how family visits could take place for Watson, and earlier this month – after restrictions were ramped-up due to the ongoing surge in cases – the visits were halted altogether, in the name of safety.“Nobody’s allowed in right now, and that’s OK with us,” Watson’s son, Larry, said last week. “I understand that they’re very strict there. I’m glad they’re doing that because it’s for the safety of everyone there.”Larry said he and his wife had shifted how they visit some time ago, to standing at a safe distance outside his mom’s window and speaking to her over the phone. They could see and hear each other more clearly than through the Plexiglas screen that had to separate them inside, he explained, and “it seems like a better visit.”The 79-year-old said it’s difficult to sum his mother’s life up in just a few lines. Words that describe her have long included artist, independent and feisty.Now, the description also includes ‘survivor of two global pandemics,’ as Watson was three years old when the Spanish Flu struck in 1918.“Her parents were affected by it, her father, he went deaf from it,” Larry said.Larry said his mom is “very surprised… and maybe a little upset” about the current pandemic, “because she can’t see her family.”“That’s the hard part for her, that she doesn’t get to see anybody.”When Watson first joined the ranks of centenarian in 2015, she welcomed aPANreporter into her home, sharing a snippet of her creative side and just a few of the countless memories and experiences she has had – from an early childhood in Saskatchewan, to seeing her first airplane, to meeting her husband while working at St. Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver, to travelling solo around the province and into the U.S. into her early nineties.“I did everything,” she said at the time.“She wasn’t scared to go out and do things,” her son said Monday.The family marked Watson’s first 100 years by publishing a book of photos, and this year, made her a blanket to take the chill off. They’re looking forward to days when they can have a proper visit.“Hopefully everything will be OK in six months or so and her family can get back in and see her.”tholmes@peacearchnews.comhttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/community/b-c-woman-who-survived-spanish-flu-marks-105-years/"

With COVID-19, it is a provincial standard to declare an outbreak if at least one staff member is at work during their infectious period, said North Island Medical Health Officer Dr. Charmaine Enns.“It’s a very concerning word,” she said during a virtual press conference on Tuesday. “But we’re talking about a single case. By definition, we expect zero cases of COVID-19 in our long-term care facilities. [One case] exceeds the number we are aiming to have in a particular site.”READ MORE: B.C. records deadliest day of pandemic with 11 deaths, 717 new COVID casesRainbow Gardens is a not-for-profit facility operated by WestCoast Native Health Care Society. At this time, there are 44 residents in long-term care, said Enns.“There have been three residents identified as close contacts, based on their interactions with staff,” she said. “All are asymptomatic.”She said the outbreak is considered a “low-risk exposure” because the staff member did not have symptoms on the days they were working and immediately stayed home and started self-isolating when symptoms occurred.“This staff member did everything right,” Enns explained.Communication with residents and families is underway. The outbreak is confined to the long-term care building and no other areas of the site are affected. The entire site is closed to admissions, transfers and visitors.In the meantime, Island Health is working with Tsawaayuus Rainbow Gardens leadership and staff to identify anyone who may have been exposed. During this time, Island Health will have additional presence at the site to take any further actions required, support the facility and answer questions from staff, residents and family members.The outbreak is not linked to any other outbreaks on the Island, Enns said. With COVID-19 cases increasing on Vancouver Island, Enns explained that it is becoming harder to identify where cases have originated.“The fact that we are seeing ever-increasing numbers, it’s going to spill over into places,” she said. “I’m just hoping we don’t feel discouraged. We’re still doing good. Let’s just regroup and get refocused on all of our efforts. Let’s keep our circles as small as possible, let’s stay home as much as possible…so that these facilities are not impacted.”She encouraged people to limit travel—including inter-Island travel—to essential trips only.READ MORE: Stop non-essential travel B.C.-wide, Dr. Bonnie Henry urgesAccording to a press release, Island Health has put “enhanced control measures” in place at Tsawaayuus Rainbow Gardens, including the following measures:Staffing levels will be maintained to provide resident care.Visitors are restricted throughout the facility.Staff and resident movement in the facility has been restricted.Cleaning and infection control measures have been enhanced.Residents, families and staff are being notified.Twice a day screening of all staff and residents.elena.rardon@albernivalleynews.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitterCoronavirusPORT ALBERNISeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/island-health-declares-regions-first-covid-19-outbreak-in-long-term-care/"

Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie heard tragic stories of the effects of strict visitor restrictions, where relatives who had helped seniors with meals, hair brushing and other essential personal assistance were told to keep their distance, shorten visits, or not visit at all.“Many residents are despondent as the only thing they look forward to is receiving a visit from their family,” Mackenzie wrote in herlatestreport, released Nov. 3. “There are also early warning signs of measurable health impacts. After many recent years of stability, the rate of antipsychotic use for residents in long-term care has increased seven per cent during this pandemic and initial reports from the quarterly assessments show troubling trends of unintended weight loss and worsening of mood among long-term care residents.”A quarter of long-term care residents die each year, and end-of-life visitation was affected as well as day-to-day help. More than eight out of 10 respondents indicated that before the pandemic, their loved one had additional people such as paid companions, physical therapists or hairdressers to help them. Personal care services are considered essential by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, along with assistance in feeding, mobility and communication, such as using a phone.Visits were restricted to essential only in March after COVID-19 transmission began in care facilities, and on June 28 one “social” visitor was allowed. The report found that most care home operators went beyond the public health orders in restricting visits to a single person. The report included some personal descriptions of the results of separation for up to six months. One resident said her sister became the designated visitor for their 98-year-old mother, meaning she couldn’t visit and her sister had to provide what both had shared.“I have asked if we could alternate monthly, one month my sister, the next month me; however this was refused,” the respondent wrote. “My mother can’t understand why I don’t visit her. I was not allowed to go in and do her hair or cut her toenails, even though I have done that for the past two decades, yet a stranger was allowed to come and do those services.”RELATED:B.C. seniors fear loneliness more than COVID-19RELATED:COVID-19 exposed senior care already in crisisAnother wrote: “I feel I am missing out on the limited time my husband has left. He doesn’t speak, so it is all the more important that he sees me. It’s interesting that the assisted living residents have the freedom to come and go, from the same building and door, with no masks. And yet I can’t get within six feet of my husband. I have asked several times to be considered an essential visitor. I need help.”Mackenzie says the issue of restricted visits has generated more phone calls and letters to her office than any other in its history. Her recommendations include allowing all long-term care residents to designate and essential care partner, and allow social visitors to determine the number allowed to balance the risk to residents’ health from long-term separation from families.@tomfletcherbctfletcher@blackpress.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.BC legislatureCoronavirusSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/b-c-seniors-suffer-from-isolation-depression-in-covid-19/"

A survey of 13,000 people from all B.C. health regions through August and September found a significant drop in frequency and duration of visits, and widespread misunderstanding of public health rules relating to visitors.The results show that more care home residents and relatives are concerned about dying of loneliness than from COVID-19, Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie said in the report, released Nov. 3“When the visit restrictions were amended at the end of June, many family members thought they would once again take up their role as a vital care partner for their loved one,” Mackenzie said in thereport. “However, two months after visit restrictions were relaxed, the survey found the majority of current visits are only once per week or less and many of these visits are 30 minutes or less, Prior to the pandemic, most family members were visiting several times a week or daily for much longer periods of time.”The survey results suggest “essential” visits have been too strictly interpreted by care home staff and frequent visitors. The report says essential visits have been defined by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, in addition to the designated “social” visitor. Essential visits “can include, but are not limited to” assistance with feeding, mobility, personal care, communication, and “compassionate care including critical illness, palliative care, hospice care, end of life and medical assistance in dying.”Decisions on who qualifies as an essential visitor were left to individual care homes to determine. Of the 13,000 survey respondents, 14 per cent said they were essential visitors. Fewer than half (48 per cent) of respondents were made aware of the potential for essential visits, only 42 per cent of respondents applied or had another family member apply for essential visits, and almost half (45 per cent) of the essential visit applications were denied.RELATED:COVID-19 exposed senior care already in crisisRELATED:Senior home residents organize to oppose restrictions“When we started visit restrictions, the goal was to ensure residents in long-term care and assisted living were kept safe from COVID-19,” Mackenzie said. “Eight months later, we need to ask the question: What are we keeping them safe for if it is not to enjoy the time they have left with the ones they love?”Mackenzie makes three recommendations:• Allow all residents to designate an essential care partner• Allow social visitors to determine the number allowed by balancing the risk to a resident’s health from the long-term family separations• Create a provincial association of long-term care and assisted living residents and family councils.@tomfletcherbctfletcher@blackpress.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.BC legislatureCoronavirusSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/b-c-seniors-worry-more-about-death-from-loneliness-than-covid-19/"

However, most outbreaks have been smaller than the first time around.COVID-19 hit Canada’s long-term care homes hardest during the first wave of the pandemic. The Public Health Agency notes that as of August, Canada had one of the highest fatality rates among long-term care home residents out of the 37 countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.Tam’s report noted that globally, Canada ranked 79th out of 201 countries in terms of total cases per million population and 26th for total deaths per million population, driven mainly by the situation in long-term care.Also, people working in essential services were at higher risk of exposure, with health-care workers accounting for 19 per cent of national cases as of mid-August and outbreaks reported in 23 agricultural workplaces during the same time frame.On Wednesday, Statistics Canada said the more than 7,000 excess deaths recorded during March and June are comparable to COVID-19 figures from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database — the official source of death-related data in Canada.The statistics agency said the number of deaths dipped to normal levels in July but has surged again during the first 10 days of October, surpassing monthly totals for August and September and suggesting Canada will see an increase in excess deaths this month.Excess mortality, more deaths than usual during a period of time, is an important measure in understanding both the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.“I think it shows the majority of excess can be accounted for by COVID-19,” Tam said. “But there could be other excess mortality, sometimes as a result of some of the measures that we’ve put in.”Tam’s report noted that opioid deaths also increased, with evidence suggesting the pandemic has created a setback as border restrictions led to a more toxic illegal drug supply.Sidhartha Banerjee, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

In total, 213 people are hospitalized in Ontario because of COVID-19; 47 people are in intensive care and 29 are on ventilators.The picture wasn’t any prettier in Quebec, which reported another 1,097 new cases on Saturday — the sixth day out of the last seven that the province surpassed 1,000 new cases.Quebec also reported 14 additional deaths. Hospitalizations rose by 11 to 444, and six more people were in intensive care, for a total of 73.In response, the province was set to expand restrictions in nearly all the regions along the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City on Saturday night.Bars, restaurant dining rooms and gyms in so-called “red zones” must be closed, sports are limited and private citizens are not allowed to gather in private homes with anyone outside their household, with few exceptions.In Manitoba, health officials reported two more deaths from COVID-19, as well as 97 new cases.The province said in its daily pandemic update on Saturday that two women in Winnipeg — one in her 80s and another in her 90s — had died since the last update on Friday.Public health officials also reminded people that residents of personal care homes are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, and that any visits over the Thanksgiving weekend should be planned with caution.Even the Atlantic bubble seems to have been perforated by the pandemic’s second wave.There were 20 new cases of COVID-19 in New Brunswick on Saturday, bringing the province’s total number of active cases to 57.The province’s chief medical officer of health said 12 of the new cases are in the Moncton region and seven are in the Campbellton region.

The benefits are numerous, she said.“The fact that they’re walking and they’re stretching and they’re reaching and touching things and even pausing to take a deep breath, in a way is wonderful for their physical [selves]…” van der Stoel said. “We had an elder who I was sitting out there with, and she just naturally began to speak about some of the difficulties of her childhood, but that nature for her was always an escape and was always a safe place. From that moment, she voiced to me that she felt safe, that she felt happy. She was able to process some of these emotions that I don’t think elders are often given the opportunity to process, but in that, she felt totally safe and secure.”RELATED:Mural unveiled at Nanaimo’s Eden GardensThe space has extra value as the pandemic has put limitations on residents, van der Stoel said. She said there have been fewer opportunities for social stimulation and because of that, loneliness and sadness.“These people miss their families and miss the routine that was existing before,” said van der Stoel. “For anybody who’s experiencing deep sadness like that, I think that nature can bring moments of peace, maybe not permanently, but at least for half an hour they get to feel peace and hopefulness and growth and vibrancy around them.”Ruth Brownstone and Shirley Petersen, residents at Eden Gardens, said they enjoy the forest.“I come out here every day to get out of the building, so it is very beneficial, so that I can have some kind of place of peace,” said Brownstone.“I like to be outdoors all the time and I don’t like to feel that I am actually in a building when I really am,” said Petersen. “I would like to not be in a building and so, to have a place of peace … it’s quite good so far.”People seeking to help out can contact van der Stoel at 250-760-2636 or atbianca.vanderstoel@edengardens.ca.

The competition features playdowns in more than 30 sports and activities between 12 zone teams from around the province, and can attract upwards of 3,600 athletes and 1,200 volunteers.The society recently added a pair of key newcomers to its board at its annual general meeting on Sept. 17, installing Surrey’s Aart Looye as president and Esquimalt’s Sharon Davies as marketing and sponsorship committee chair.RELATED STORY:55+ BC Games cancelled amid COVID-19 concernsDavies, an accomplished amateur athlete and organizer with varied professional and volunteer experience in strategic planning, promotions and fundraising, is excited to serve on the society’s board.“It’s a great opportunity to give back and try to promote an active lifestyle,” she said. For participants, she added, “it’s an opportunity to continue to compete in a sport that you love, but it is also about participation and having fun.”While the society is monitoring provincial health regulations around COVID-19 as it plans its next attempt at staging the Games, Davies, a Bays United women’s soccer player, is encouraged at the work being done by various sports organizations in Greater Victoria to come up with Safe Return to Play protocols. She hopes the Games can draw on those experiences to create a safe environment for all participants.From an economic standpoint, hosting a 55+ BC Games can be a lucrative proposition, Davies said, as all visiting participants book hotel rooms, eat in local restaurants and enjoy other activities while in the host city. It’s not uncommon for participants to extend their stays.Davies’ duties as committee chair will include securing funding from sponsors.

She took the game up alongside Louise after retiring at 71 years old. She described the senior league as good exercise, but said the social aspect is every bit as important with many friendships forged between the lanes.Although she is no longer averaging the 192 point games she once did, Pineo is still more than capable of putting in a good ten frames. She attributes this longevity to family history and an overall healthy lifestyle.“I’m very careful with my health, I don’t drink or smoke and I rest a lot, I’m just a healthy person,” she said.“I think it’s good for you, you can’t just sit around on the chesterfield waiting to die or that sort of thing. You should remain active and keep the proper perspective.”Pineo was happy to discover that the league, which usually runs from September until May, was able to reopen. It had been stopped short due to COVID-19 in the spring. She said the virus made it difficult to get out and do things she enjoys for much of the year, so the return of the bowling league was a welcome return to a treasured routine.READ MORE:BC Votes 2020: Horgan talks mass timber, climate targets in visit to RevelstokeREAD MORE:Confronting their addictions to make way for healing — a B.C. love storyjim.elliot@saobserver.netLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitterSeniorsSportshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/sports/salmon-arm-woman-one-of-the-oldest-competitive-bowlers-in-western-canada/"

The coronavirus pandemic has unexpectedly provided new insights into how nursing homes should be designed to help control the spread of any type of illness. The timing is especially beneficial as Baptist Housing works on its plans for the first phase of the Inglewood Care Centre redevelopment.This past February, BC Housing financed the sale of the aging facility and three adjacent lots to Baptist Housing, which owns and operates 21 care homes in British Columbia. With a large financial commitment from the province, as well as Vancouver Coastal Health, Baptist Housing came up with plan to subsidize the construction of a replacement care home by creating a community of housing on the site. The total of 699 proposed units also includes private-pay units, life leases and rental apartments for staff.In mid-September, the District of West Vancouver allowed the project to move to the public consultation stage.In advance of the first public open house on Oct. 6, the North Shore News talked with Howard Johnson, Baptist Housing CEO and president, and Marc Kinna, executive vice-president operations and chief operating officer. They walked through some of the ways they’re adapting traditional nursing home designs to ensure residents and staff can enjoy a better quality of life and work during a pandemic.“COVID-19 has taught us about the risk of bringing a virus from the outside world into the residences of these seniors,” Kinna says. “We have to remember that they don’t life where we work we work in their home. This has really transformed our thinking around that.”As well, the changes will keep residents healthier, pandemic or not. “Every single design element that will make the building better, and the experience better for residents, also applies to other forms of illness,” he says. “We’re hoping that the incidence of other communicable illnesses such as influenza, the Norwalk virus and the common cold will be lesser as well.”Because many of these design changes can be incorporated into the original plans, they are optimistic they won’t add much to the overall cost of the construction.Room, sweet roomhttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/lessons-from-a-pandemic-how-to-design-a-nursing-home-thats-safe-and-love-filled/"

However, the trigger point for starting CARHR, he added, was the introduction of a restriction regarding visitors at B.C.’s retirement homes and long-term care facilities.SEE ALSO:B.C. senior home survey to measure COVID-19 impactsThe current provincial guidelines restrict visits to one designated family member or friend.O’Brien, who is the CEO of the new association, said the restriction should be adjusted to allow two people to visit at the same time. Allowing only one person, he said, is no different than being told to pick your favourite child.“If you’ve got three children and 10 grandchildren, only one of those are ever allowed to visit you. That’s a horrible situation,” he said.One of the first actions of the association was to write an open letter to Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. While the letter commends her “exceptional efforts” to control COVID-19, it takes issue with her position on long-term care home visitors.“There is one regulation you have endorsed that begs for your re-assessment. The imposition of the very cruel and inhumane order that separates families. You have separated families and forced those seniors living in retirement homes to endure a long period of extreme stress with their isolation,” O’Brien wrote.“There can be little justification for restricting visiting at retirement homes to one designated visitor.”Monday afternoon, after announcing six new deaths and 317 new cases of COVID-19 over the weekend, Dr. Henry said there are currently 13 long-term care homes where there are COVID-19 outbreaks.Henry said she does not envision the province increasing restrictions on visitors, but acknowledged the challenges that come with loosening them.“The difficulty we have with long-term care is that it’s not just our person that is in there, it’s everybody who’s at risk,” Dr. Henry said.B.C. Minister of Health Adrian Dix said the most common concern his office receives relates to visitor restrictions at long-term care homes.“We’ve taken a very methodical approach to dealing with it,” Dix said during the news briefing.“It’s clear that we want, as a goal, to increase the number of visits but we have to put that into context. COVID-19 is obviously unbelievably harmful, potentially harmful, to people living in long-term care.”The association, O’Brien said, is a vehicle for people to speak out if they’re otherwise afraid to do so.“The people in these homes, especially the long-term care homes, they either don’t want to speak (or) they’re afraid to speak,” he said. “Most people, even in here, are reluctant to speak because they’re reluctant to offend the manager. Now, in our case, we have a really great manager, but I’m more about the long-term care where all of these people have died tragically.”O’Brien described Amica as “top of the heap,” however, he said the degree of stress felt by himself and neighbours varies depending on individual circumstances and family relationships.SEE ALSO:B.C. records 132 more COVID-19 cases, one in long-term care“Yeah, people are stressed, there’s no doubt about it. But seniors don’t show their stress as much as younger people might. When you’re age 70, 80, 90, you’ve learned to deal with stress to some extent, at least you learn to hide it.”O’Brien and Kirstiuk are hoping to recruit volunteer board members.“That’s probably the most important issue we have right now,” he said.The ultimate goal is to have the association run by children and grandchildren of residents living in long-term care or retirement homes. O’Brien envisions seniors sharing concerns with their family members, which would then be relayed to the association. Those concerns would then be brought to the proper authorities.“That’s what has been totally missing. We’ve had no way to connect.”To learn more about the association or to request to join, O’Brien can be contacted at ldobmob@gmail.com or 778-966-5261.aaron.hinks@peacearchnews.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitterCoronavirusSeniorsSurreywhite rockhttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/b-c-retirement-home-residents-fight-provinces-visitor-restrictions/"

The study found that women who were single, widowed, divorced or separated had higher likelihood of being affected by general obesity than men.“There is a lot of literature suggesting that marriage is health-promoting for men and potentially less so for women, so our results about marital status were kind of surprising,” said Annalijn Conklin, principal investigator of the study and assistant professor in pharmaceutical sciences at UBC.Zeinab Hosseini, lead author of the study, said in a press release that more research is needed to completely “understand the factors at work,” but suggested that more needs to be done to encourage older women to build social ties.“This would require clear implementation strategies, and a focus on social connection interventions by health care researchers and decision-makers,” said Hosseini.ALSO READ:Canadians not getting enough light exercise during pandemic, UBC study findsConklin added that building these social ties could include activities like visiting friends and family, and engaging in group hobbies that encourage older adults to build connections outside their existing circles.The study did not investigate why these gender differences exist, but Conklin suggested that they may be due to social expectations of gender roles.“The type of work we did was taking a big data set and looking at how relationships affect men and women,” said Conklin. “That topic would require a completely different type of study, and maybe that’s the next step.”Like us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism?

The proportion of LTC deaths ranged from less than 10 per cent in Slovenia and Hungary to 31 per cent in the United States to 66 per cent in Spain.At 5,324, the reported number of LTC deaths in Canada was near the average but data varied widely among countries: from 28 in Australia to 30,000 in the U.S., with more than 10,000 in France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.Researchers point to limitations that prevent some comparisons — countries vary in COVID-19 testing and reporting practices, and in their definition of long-term care.In addition, COVID-19 cases are often under-reported and in the case of Italy, data was available from only 52 per cent of the nursing homes operating in the country.Nevertheless, Tracy Johnson, CIHI’s director of health systems analysis and emerging issues, says the data offers valuable insight into a tragedy many families, caregivers and residents have been trying to illustrate since the pandemic began.Johnson notes countries that implemented additional LTC precautions at the same time as standard stay-at-home orders had fewer LTC infections and deaths.That includes Australia, Austria and Slovenia, which ordered broad LTC testing and training, isolation wards to manage clusters, surge staffing, specialized teams and personal protective equipment.Johnson says the findings suggest such measures could be key to mitigating the impact of a possible second wave.But for now, she notes several of Canada’s hardest-hit facilities are still grappling with the devastating fallout of existing infections.“Even if all of these (measures are instituted) there will be other folks who will die because some people are infected right now, still, and the outbreaks are still ongoing,” she says.“Some of the control measures though will probably help to at least keep the rates the same as they are.”READ MORE:Canadian Armed Forces members at risk of COVID-19 while on long-term care duty to get extra payThe contrast in LTC deaths is even more stark between provinces and territories, says the report, which notes LTC deaths represented more than 70 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta and 97 per cent of all deaths in Nova Scotia.There were none in Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and the territories at the time of the study.

And he suggests it’s time to put provincially-driven long-term care mandates under the Canada Health Act.“I see the federal government having its role in terms of setting the national standards and benchmarking so that expectations are set (and) no matter which province or territory our older Canadians are living in they can be protected in the same way under that framework,” says Wong.“(For) individual provinces and territories, it is about implementation of those national, federally set benchmarks and standards.”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-57');gptRefreshSlots.push(57); });The CIHI analysis compared Canada to countries that had sufficient data for reporting: Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });Cassandra Szklarski, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

Ask questions if they are acting unusual and trust your instincts if you feel that something is not right.”Discuss oftenReminding the older adults in your life of the importance of not giving out personal or financial information to people you don’t know or over the phone is an important first step.However, by simply opening the financial and fraud prevention dialogue, you build rapport and make it more likely your loved one will reach out to you if there is ever a concern that needs to be addressed.“Having discussions about fraud prevention is an important subject to broach,” Haarhoff said. “Having these conversations early and often could provide the older adults in your life the knowledge they need to identify a potential fraud or scam if they are ever faced with one.”Should you feel someone in your life is being abused or mistreated, contact Seniors First BC via the Seniors Abuse and Information Line (SAIL) toll-free at: 1-866-437-1940.RELATED:LETTER – Get to know your neighbours for World Elder Abuse Awareness DayDo you have something to add to this story, or something else we should report on?Email:jenna.hauck@theprogress.comTwitter:@PhotoJennalismLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/tips-on-how-to-protect-your-aging-loved-ones-from-financial-abuse/"

Those agreements — more than $11 billion over a decade — required provinces to produce plans for how the funds would be allocated.Duncan said she doesn’t have a specific national dollar figure in mind but is looking for everything from money to hire more workers, to prioritizing the delivery of personal protective equipment and rapid on-site COVID-19 testing, as well as infrastructure funds that will help make some of the older, smaller homes better able to prevent infection and isolate patients when they become ill.Last week, Trudeau said long-term care was on the agenda when he and premiers had their weekly COVID-19 conference call. He has not yet put any specifics on the table and has noted the provinces have jurisdiction.“I said to the premiers, our government will be there to support them as we work together to ensure that our elders receive the care they deserve,” Trudeau said Friday.Duncan’s organization represents about 70 per cent of the 626 long-term care homes in Ontario, but she said it is working with national and other provincial associations as well.Long-term care homes have borne the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada to date, with more than 4,000 residents dying in Ontario and Quebec alone. The Canadian Armed Forces deployed more than 1,000 members to care homes in Quebec and Ontario which were unable to look after patients with so many staff members sick.Last week, the military reported serious problems in homes in both provinces.Quebec Premier Francois Legault is mulling over a full-scale overhaul of his province’s system for caring for seniors in their final years, while Ontario Premier Doug Ford has promised an independent commission to investigate the failings of his province’s care homes starting in July.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });Duncan said the commission and investigations are welcome but the residents and the workers who care for them need something a whole lot faster than that.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });“We’re a bit concerned that everyone wants to be reflective now, as if this is over,” she said. “It is not over. This is the beginning. Let’s not become complacent. We have got to keep focused on keeping this out of our homes and protecting our seniors.”In Ontario, more than 5,000 care-home residents have been diagnosed with COVID-19, almost one-fifth of all the confirmed cases in the province to date. As of Tuesday, 1,465 residents had died of it, representing almost two-thirds of the province’s total death count.Another 1,825 long-term care home workers have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and seven have died.There are still outbreaks at more than 1,000 facilities in Ontario, affecting at least 1,000 patients and more than 900 staff.More than 2,000 long-term care residents have died in Quebec, and thousands more have been infected. A handful of care homes saw every single resident test positive for COVID-19.More than 100 residents of long-term care homes in British Columbia have also died of COVID-19.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });In Ontario, Duncan said long-term care homes where residents live in three- or four-patient rooms were the hardest hit by the outbreaks. Others that saw outbreaks use fans instead of air conditioning, which contributed to the spread of infected droplets, and have things like carpeting which is harder to keep clean.She wants funds to fix some of those issues, including immediately preparing to reduce rooms to a maximum of two patients. However, in Ontario that will mean needing to find space for 10,000 beds.The federal-provincial agreements should also look to the future, said Duncan, where an aging population is going to drive up the need for more long-term care homes. In Ontario alone, she said 100,000 new beds and 100,000 new workers will be needed over the next 15 years.But the looming threat of another wave of infections is “what keeps me up at night,” said Duncan.She said the fear and stigma about working in long-term care homes is high right now, so an aggressive recruitment and skills-training initiative is going to be crucial, along with better pay for those workers. She believes two or three months is enough time to do some decent skill-building and recruitment drives.Ottawa, which is helping provinces procure protective equipment like face masks, shields and medical gowns and gloves, needs to be sure to include long-term care homes on its priority list, she said.

107,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/federal-aid-for-care-home-systems-needed-ahead-of-second-wave-advocates-say/,"Jun 3, 2020","Federal aid for care home systems needed ahead of second wave, advocates say","The federal government must do more to help provinces prepare long-term care homes for the next wave of COVID-19, the Ontario Long Term Care Association says.Association CEO Donna Duncan is calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to quickly negotiate an agreement with provincial governments to deliver funds to help long-term care systems ramp up preparations as soon as possible.“We need to act fast,” she said, noting many experts think the second-wave of novel coronavirus infections will hit no later than September.She is looking for an agreement along the lines of the 2017 deals signed between Ottawa and provincial governments to flow money for mental health and home care. Those agreements — more than $11 billion over a decade — required provinces to produce plans for how the funds would be allocated.Duncan said she doesn’t have a specific national dollar figure in mind but is looking for everything from money to hire more workers, to prioritizing the delivery of personal protective equipment and rapid on-site COVID-19 testing, as well as infrastructure funds that will help make some of the older, smaller homes better able to prevent infection and isolate patients when they become ill.Last week, Trudeau said long-term care was on the agenda when he and premiers had their weekly COVID-19 conference call. He has not yet put any specifics on the table and has noted the provinces have jurisdiction.“I said to the premiers, our government will be there to support them as we work together to ensure that our elders receive the care they deserve,” Trudeau said Friday.Duncan’s organization represents about 70 per cent of the 626 long-term care homes in Ontario, but she said it is working with national and other provincial associations as well.Long-term care homes have borne the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada to date, with more than 4,000 residents dying in Ontario and Quebec alone. The Canadian Armed Forces deployed more than 1,000 members to care homes in Quebec and Ontario which were unable to look after patients with so many staff members sick.Last week, the military reported serious problems in homes in both provinces.Quebec Premier Francois Legault is mulling over a full-scale overhaul of his province’s system for caring for seniors in their final years, while Ontario Premier Doug Ford has promised an independent commission to investigate the failings of his province’s care homes starting in July.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });Duncan said the commission and investigations are welcome but the residents and the workers who care for them need something a whole lot faster than that.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });“We’re a bit concerned that everyone wants to be reflective now, as if this is over,” she said. “It is not over. This is the beginning. Let’s not become complacent. We have got to keep focused on keeping this out of our homes and protecting our seniors.”In Ontario, more than 5,000 care-home residents have been diagnosed with COVID-19, almost one-fifth of all the confirmed cases in the province to date. As of Tuesday, 1,465 residents had died of it, representing almost two-thirds of the province’s total death count.Another 1,825 long-term care home workers have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and seven have died.There are still outbreaks at more than 1,000 facilities in Ontario, affecting at least 1,000 patients and more than 900 staff.More than 2,000 long-term care residents have died in Quebec, and thousands more have been infected. A handful of care homes saw every single resident test positive for COVID-19.More than 100 residents of long-term care homes in British Columbia have also died of COVID-19.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });In Ontario, Duncan said long-term care homes where residents live in three- or four-patient rooms were the hardest hit by the outbreaks. Others that saw outbreaks use fans instead of air conditioning, which contributed to the spread of infected droplets, and have things like carpeting which is harder to keep clean.She wants funds to fix some of those issues, including immediately preparing to reduce rooms to a maximum of two patients. However, in Ontario that will mean needing to find space for 10,000 beds.The federal-provincial agreements should also look to the future, said Duncan, where an aging population is going to drive up the need for more long-term care homes. In Ontario alone, she said 100,000 new beds and 100,000 new workers will be needed over the next 15 years.But the looming threat of another wave of infections is “what keeps me up at night,” said Duncan.She said the fear and stigma about working in long-term care homes is high right now, so an aggressive recruitment and skills-training initiative is going to be crucial, along with better pay for those workers. She believes two or three months is enough time to do some decent skill-building and recruitment drives.Ottawa, which is helping provinces procure protective equipment like face masks, shields and medical gowns and gloves, needs to be sure to include long-term care homes on its priority list, she said. In the preparations for the first wave, hospitals were the focus for those things, and care-home workers were left short.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });Duncan said there are solutions, but it is going to take resolve and creativity to put them into action.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-57');gptRefreshSlots.push(57); });“We’re all going to have to problem solve together and try to figure this out,” she said.Mia Rabson, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

So, a quick scramble pulled all the elements together for a great wedding on May 15.“It’s unbelievable to have planned a wedding during a pandemic and within three days while working from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. on all the days beforehand,” Scheck said.Unfortunately, her stepfather Brian Devlin, 79, died on May 24.“To our amazement, he was very aware of everything that was going on. And he looked up at me and smiled when they asked who gave me away. I have the pic captured. A very touching moment,” Scheck said.The bride and groom both work at Discovery Harbour Seniors Community which allowed them to hold the wedding on their grounds in the garden. Plus dad was a resident of the centre. A quick set up on the day of the wedding had everything ready to go and all the residents watched out the windows, waving and smiling.“My stepdad was wheeled down dressed up and he was coherent the whole time he was present, something he hasn’t been prior to. He talked about fishing and was happy to see his family. He was proud and that’s why we did this on such short notice. It truly was a wonderful moment!”“When we said ‘I do.’ all three floors of the facility were banging on the windows, some were present outside with us, and they all stood at the windows and watched the ceremony with smiles on their faces. We had some fellow co-workers in the crowd cheering us on and taking pics for us.”The happy couple were deeply appreciative of the love and support they received.It took a whole host of businesses and people making themselves available on short notice to make it happen. All in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.The bride was overjoyed that it all came together in time so her father could be there.“This is a story of love and also a story of the great community we live in,” Scheck said.RELATED:Couple celebrates 61st anniversary through Vancouver Island seniors’ home windowRELATED:Sisters surprised to find themselves reunited at Nanaimo seniors care home after years apart@AlstrTeditor@campbellrivermirror.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitterCampbell RiverCoronavirusSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/stepdad-able-to-walk-bride-down-the-aisle-days-before-he-passes-away/"

The grants, up to $5,000 each, come from the federal government’s COVID-19 seniors response fund.Twenty-five agencies north of the Malahat are sharing the money, including Eden Gardens, Nanaimo Age Friendly Community Society, Nanaimo Community Hospice, People for a Healthy Community on Gabriola Island Society, Salvation Army Nanaimo Ministries and Tillicum Lelum Aboriginal Friendship Centre.“We know our local charities are working overtime to help seniors who need access to food, social connection and other supports,” said Signy Madden, executive director of United Way Central and Northern Vancouver Island, in the release. “Knowing what agencies are effective and what the needs are on the ground in our Vancouver Island communities has allowed United Way to channel this much-needed federal funding quickly to where it is needed most.”Deb Schulte, federal Minister of Seniors, said in the press release that the physical distancing that she called “essential” during the pandemic comes with risks of isolating seniors from their communities.“This funding will help provide support tailored to the unique, local needs of seniors across the country,” she said.United Way is reminding people that it is continuing to raise money to help vulnerable people across the region during the pandemic and asks for support for its Local Love in a Global Crisis campaign.

The other occurred in North Vancouver’s Lynn Valley Care Centre and started in March. That outbreak end with 76 people, including 52 elderly residents and 26 staff at the care home being diagnosed with COVID. Twenty of the residents died.In the latest report from Langley Lodge issued late this morning, there were now 21 active cases among residents, eight among staff, and zero new cases, with still six recovered.“There have been more deaths since yesterday (May 20); sadly, three of our residents who were positive for COVID-19,” the Lodge’s CEO Debra Hauptman postedonlineyesterday.“Our staff are saddened by the loss of these residents and we extend our sincere condolences to the families. We acknowledge the challenging time we are in and the impact of this loss on the families of our residents,” she added.The Lodge received news Wednesday that a healthcare worker from FHA, who came to assist with the outbreak, tested positive for COVID-19. The healthcare worker worked on a unit where they have not had any cases to date.And while the worker wore wearing personal protective equipment and had minimal contact with residents, the Lodge has had to upgrade outbreak measures, including confining residents to their rooms.All residents and families have been informed of “the unfortunate development” by the CEO and medical director Dr. Mitchell Fagan.“We will be monitoring the residents closely and we hope to get through this latest development without any further cases,” Hauptman said in her online update.The virus was introduced into their dementia unit by an infected worker on April 27.“There are 26 frail elderly residents in this unit who also have advanced dementia. Due to their cognitive impairment these residents are not able to understand social distancing to prevent the spread of infection. Normally, residents with advanced dementia are very mobile, actively touching surfaces in their unit,” she said.“This situation presented a unique set of challenges for infection control, combined with a highly contagious strain of this virus introduced into a high-risk population,” Hauptman said.She’s often being asked if there is anything that they need.“All of us in Langley Lodge are very appreciative of the kind messages that families have been sending to us. Our staff are working tremendously hard under difficult circumstances to care for loved ones. Please continue to support our staff with your messages of encouragement and compassion.

But we learned from that,” Henry said.Authorities took a “swat team approach” to the outbreak with measures that included “very sensitive surveillance” and testing, Henry told a recent news conference.Outbreaks have been declared in 34 facilities in B.C. since the start of the pandemic, but more than half of those long-term care homes no longer have any cases.Henry said those outbreaks have been responsible for the majority of the deaths in the province.Over 400 residents and staff at B.C. care homes have tested positive for the virus. Vancouver Coastal Health has had 14 outbreaks in long-term homes and two in acute care facilities.READ MORE:B.C. will ‘have to find a way’ for families to visit seniors in longterm care: advocateJust as infections began in B.C.’s care homes, care facilities for seniors in Ontario and Quebec were also being ravaged by the new coronavirus causing a large proportion of the country’s now more than 4,400 deaths.About 80 per cent of Quebec’s pandemic deaths have occurred at long-term care and seniors residences that have been infected with the novel coronavirus.More than 1,200 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed among residents in Ontario care homes, which account for about half the 478 known deaths.Schwandt said Vancouver Coastal Health learned from the experiences of Quebec and Ontario and what they were seeing in outbreaks internationally.“In a couple of outbreaks, we’ve tested all the staff regardless of symptoms and we have found people who had no symptoms at all and later became ill with COVID-19,” he said.Staff started extensive use of personal protective equipment, visits were cut off and those diagnosed were isolated.Then they began testing for the virus around the facilities.“In some cases, they found COVID-19 to contaminate equipment or parts of the facility … equipment carts or blood pressure cups,” he said. ”The building itself is of high quality but the risk of contamination within buildings with COVID-19 is something we’ve been learning more about.”The buildings were deep cleaned depending on the specific facility, equipment and how much traffic they saw, he said.Schwandt said he recommends “very proactive” testing within facilities and cautious tracing of known cases.“Even a small amount of contact, we have found, can lead to a transmission between residents and staff and so it’s important to look very closely at even limited contact and monitor them for symptoms.”READ MORE:No easy fix for long-term care, but it starts with working conditions: expertsAnd while the risk of illness from the new coronavirus does seem to be more serious among seniors, Schwandt said several of them have recovered.Dr. Roger Wong, a clinical professor of geriatric medicine at the University of British Columbia’s faculty of medicine, said the pandemic has unmasked a number of serious issues faced by long-term care facilities.Not only do the care facilities need to address infection prevention and control but also underlying physical- and mental-health conditions, he said.“Those seniors who have more severe form of dementia, they are definitely at higher risk of COVID-19,” Wong said.Alzheimer’s patients tend to wander and might become infected in their travel through the facility, he said.While measures such as testing, tracing, extensive use of personal protective equipment and cleaning can help combat the spread of the virus, Wong said a “paradigm shift in the underlying culture and understanding and value of these homes” is required to help control future infections.He said these aren’t just facilities for seniors, they are their homes.“That understanding will drive further change.”Hina Alam, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

So I think what will happen is…we’re going to look back at this through a lens of what was reasonable under the circumstances,” he said.“The interesting question will be, what is the standard of care during a pandemic?”The courts will likely look to the requirements and guidelines issued by health ministries, the World Health Organization and other similar bodies in gauging whether any defendants were negligent, Smitiuch said.READ MORE:B.C. will ‘have to find a way’ for families to visit seniors in longterm care: advocateThe novel coronavirus has ravaged private and government-run seniors’ homes, particularly in Canada’s two largest provinces, causing a large proportion of the country’s more than 3,000 deaths.Rules and standards for nursing homes have evolved rapidly as public health officials respond to the crisis, with several provinces now banning staff from working in multiple facilities.However, a number of proposed class-action lawsuits allege negligence on the part of governments or nursing home operators in their handling of the virus.In Quebec, the son of a 94-year-old woman who died of COVID-19 at one of the province’s hardest-hit facilities has filed a class-action application against the government-run CHSLD Ste-Dorothee.A Toronto law firm, meanwhile, has served the provincial government with notice of a proposed class proceeding on behalf of all Ontarians in long-term care homes.It alleges the province’s failures in overseeing the facilities have resulted in widespread, avoidable illness and death during the pandemic.Another such lawsuit launched by two Ontario men whose mothers died from COVID-19 targets Revera, a privately owned nursing home company.None of the cases have been certified as class actions so far and their claims have not been tested in court.Scott Stanley, a personal injury lawyer in Vancouver, said these lawsuits and any others that surface in the coming months will face multiple hurdles in meeting the criteria for negligence.First, he said, it may be difficult for plaintiffs to show the actions of the operators or government caused the deaths.“If the theory is, well, workers were able to go from one home to the other and transmit the virus — that’s a theory, but you have to show factually that that actually caused other people to be affected or infected,” he said.It may also be challenging to demonstrate that the care given fell below established standards, particularly when suing governments, since they are measured against the standards they created, Stanley said.Governments could also introduce legislation to protect themselves against COVID-19 related lawsuits, although there is a “very live debate” over whether they can preclude cases involving breaches of charter rights, he said.Such laws are generally “very unpopular” politically, he said.Even if any of the proposed class actions are successful, plaintiffs may be shocked to find the damages they receive are minimal, he said.“People are not compensated for the loss of companionship, the loss of friendship, from an older person that’s deceased,” he said.“You’re basically compensating for the loss of economic benefits they brought to you. And most older people are not in a position where they’re providing economic benefits…so in many instances those claims are actually worth nothing.”In truly egregious cases, a nursing home could face punitive damages, which are meant to deter certain conduct, said Smitiuch, the Toronto lawyer.Governments should also consider an inquiry into how care homes responded to the crisis, he said.“It would be something that would be valuable for the future, because no doubt we’ll be facing something like this sometime in the future,” he said.Three professional orders in Quebec have said they will hold a joint investigation into the situation at seniors’ homes and long-term care centres since the COVID-19 pandemic struck.Paola Loriggio, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.CoronavirusSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/lawsuits-over-covid-19-handling-in-nursing-homes-raise-questions-about-standard-of-care/"

The couple has two children, six grandchildren, eight great grandchildren, and now a great-great grandchild.But, with the arrival of COVID and the necessity for self-isolating, that became impossible. Maybe, Serr said, a family gathering can be planned once the dangers of the pandemic are quelled.Asked what it’s like to celebrate such a milestone anniversary, Violet said: “We celebrated so many of them, it doesn’t seem like anything different.”But admittedly, this one is very different, Serr interjected, since they won’t be able to actually celebrate together.This couple was married in Winnipeg in 1944, six months after they met at a community barn dance that Violet admittedly didn’t even want to attend.As if it was yesterday, Violet recounted how she came in and spotted a Canadian air force mechanic huddled by the woodstove trying to stay warm. He captivated her and the rest was history.“I looked over, and he looked over, and that was it… We danced for the rest of the night,” Violet said.Reflecting back on their life together, and what got them through, both agree “a good sense of humour,” has been essential.“Nobody can live that long without an argument once in a while,” Roy added. “But, you get over that and carry on.”Their lengthy love story continues to inspire Serr.“They have been through polio, Scarlett fever, the Second World War – of which dad is a veteran – and now this. Still able to laugh, tell a joke, and of course [share] so many wonderful stories,” Serr said. “It’s quite something to be together for 76 years… This is a wonderful story of love and sorrow and always a shining smile through their life adventures.”SIMILAR MILESTONE: B.C. grandpa beats heart attack amid COVID-19 to celebrate 71st wedding anniversary.• If there is more to this story, please let us know about it.

And their activities, outings and respite care have been mostly taken away by isolation restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19.B.C. Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie says the province has fewer options for direct support, but it is reaching out virtually with a toll-free help line at 1-877-520-3267, and a new website, familycaregiversBC.cato provide support. The province has provided an additional $500,000 to the Family Caregivers of B.C. to better connect people who are taking care of elderly relatives.“I know the help you really need right now is some relief from your caregiving duties, and some time for yourself,” Mackenzie said April 26. “That’s incredibly challenging to provide for you right now. But you may find some comfort, if you can share your burden with those who understand it best. Please call Family Caregivers of BC directly, or connect through 2-1-1 and allow them to help.”Since March, B.C.’s 2-1-1 line and its websitebc211.cahave been connecting the thousands of volunteers offering meal and medicine deliveries or friendly virtual visits for seniors isolated in the pandemic. In the first four weeks, it has delivered more than 12,000 virtual visits, nearly 3,000 grocery deliveries and 2,800 meals.RELATED:B.C.’s 2-1-1 hotline expands to link seniors, volunteersRELATED:Respite care, adult day programs expanded in 2018“There are over 5,500 British Columbians who have volunteered so far,” Mackenzie said. “It grows every day. I see selfless acts of kindness being extended to seniors in every neighbourhood of this province.”Even self-sufficient seniors currently don’t have the option of visiting activity centres or libraries, where some were getting internet service.Providing adequate, affordable home care has long been a struggle for the province, and the pandemic has aggravated that problem with the suspension of day programs. She urged people to use 2-1-1 or the new support line for advice and assistance.“Others might receive respite from a care worker who comes into their home and allows the family member to get out, run errands, and be out and about in the community and get some relief,” Mackenzie said. “Now, with COVID-19, we’re finding that some families are cancelling some, or all, of their home respite in order to control the number of people that are coming into the home.”Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said home medical and care visits are being managed differently than senior care facilities, where visitors are strictly limited.“There is guidance that we’ve provided for home support and for home care, nurses that go into the home to provide support as well,” Henry said in her daily briefing April 23. “It involves things like minimizing the people in the room.“If you have to provide direct support, making sure that you have the appropriate tools to do it safely, making sure that you can clean your hands, that you can wear gloves, if necessary, and masks, if necessary. But also, recognizing that we don’t want you having contact with all the other family members that might be in the home.”@tomfletcherbctfletcher@blackpress.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.BC legislatureCoronavirusSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/covid-19-adds-to-burden-of-caring-for-b-c-seniors-at-home/"

Henry asked all assisted living facilities to allow “essential visits only,” which has led to a stoppage of family visits.Hundreds of staff and seniors at longterm care facilities have been infected with the virus, leading to many of B.C.’s 100 deaths. There are currently outbreaks at 19 facilities, with outbreaks at a further 10 homes being declared over. Speaking last week, Henry said seniors in longterm careare offered the “full spectrum of care,”but most do not opt for hospitalization when they get the virus.On Sunday, Mackenzie said spouses and children must be able to see their loved ones in longterm care. She said that amid B.C.’s “new normal,” the assisted living sector will need to figure out “some form of visits from family members,” before a vaccine is developed – which could be as much as a year away.She noted that Henry’s guidance did specifically allow for some visits, including for compassionate and palliative care, and to assist with feeding and mobility.“I am going to be communicating to the care homes to carefully look at that language and make accommodations where they can.”Mackenzie acknowledged the visits will be highly restricted and may not be possible at all facilities.“If there is an active outbreak of COVID-19 in the care home that makes it more difficult,” she said.“People going a year or more without seeing their spouse… is tragic.”Mackenzie said family members not only support their loved one in the care home but also to be the “eyes that see and the ears that hear” to ensure care is up to standards.READ MORE:‘You are not alone’: B.C. pledges $500K to help family caregivers amid COVID-19 pandemicREAD MORE:B.C. care home site of virus recovery study, Bonnie Henry saysREAD MORE:B.C.’s senior home staff measures show results in COVID-19 battle@katslepiankatya.slepian@bpdigital.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.CoronavirusSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/b-c-will-have-to-find-a-way-for-families-to-visit-seniors-in-longterm-care-advocate/"

There is support, you are not alone,” she said.According to the organization, there are more than one million family caregivers in B.C. providing 80 per cent of care for elderly, disabled or sick loved ones.Other recently introduced programs amid the pandemic include matching lists of volunteers to seniors in need. Mackenzie said in the past four week, the program has led to 12,193 virtual visits, 2,957 grocery deliveries and 2,782 meals.Amid recorded spikes in domestic violence calls due to isolation, Mackenzie said her officer has not seen an increase in calls about elder abuse at this time.READ MORE:Wheelchair contraption reconnects South Surrey seniors – from a distanceREAD MORE:Canada’s top doctor says measures ‘starting to pay off’, even as COVID-19 deaths near 2,500Like us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.CoronavirusSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/you-are-not-alone-b-c-pledges-500k-to-help-family-caregivers-amid-covid-19-pandemic/"

They leave the supplies on the front step, ring the bell and be on their way.“We’re gloved 100 per cent of the time because we are in a business where we are basically washing our hands all the time anyway. We understand the necessity of that cleaning,” Strong said.The idea was posted on social media and it has “taken off” right across the country. Strong estimates that the Campbell River crew could accommodate one or two people a day.Strong said it is done strictly on a volunteer basis by his employees, he has eight up and down the Island.“I haven’t had one per who said no,” Strong said.They’re willing to go and buy the “necessities of life” for people. They’re not going to go and buy a game for someone or six flats of beer. But on the other hand, one person asked them to pick up a bottle of wine and Strong said, “No problem.”“trying to keep life comfortable,” is the aim, Strong said.The motivation for the services is straightforward.“We just want to help our community as much as possible during this time. If there is anything we do to help, just reach out,” Strong said.If you’d like some help with the groceries, email: jmarshall@meninkilts.com.Men In Kilts provides commercial window and building exterior washing services and uses a distinctive green tartan theme as their corporate colours and their staff wear green tartan kilts.RELATED:Sisters surprised to find themselves reunited at Nanaimo seniors care home after years apart@AlstrTeditor@campbellrivermirror.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitterCoronavirusSeniorsCampbell River’s Men In Kilts franchise staff are volunteering to deliver groceries to people who are less able to get out and buy their own during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Specifically, a cloth bag filled with wheat husks and sewn tight, so that it can be warmed in a microwave oven and used over and over for comfort.Ruth is now sharing her story about a house fire that she says began with the heating of one of these packs.Read about COVID:IH makes changes to protect seniors receiving careIt was the morning of March 11, and her day started out like any other.She rose early, had a bite to eat, and a little later, the 81-year old decided to lie down and watch T.V., maybe even catch a little shut-eye.First, Ruth warmed up her heat pack in the microwave – she calls it her “bean bag” – then put it on her feet, and settled in on her chesterfield for a rest.Next thing she remembers is being woken up by the clanging of the recycling truck in the back alley, after all it was her garbage pickup and recycle day.But when she opened her eyes, her quaint East Trail home was filled with smoke and thick with the acrid smell of something burning.Luckily, Ruth’s couch was very close to the back door. Feeling slightly off-kilter, all she could think of doing was opening up the door to let some air in, and get herself more oriented.Once she did that, however, the breath of fresh air – full of oxygen – was so forceful that Ruth was blown back in a whoosh and the couch instantly ignited in flames as high as five feet.Meanwhile, in the seconds this all took to happen, the Alpine recycling worker smelled smoke, glanced around, and saw Ruth’s face at the door and the flicker of flames behind her.He ran up to the house, helped her outside, then quickly pulled the foam cushions off the couch and dragged them into the backyard. His quick thinking saved Ruth and likely saved her entire house from going up in a blaze.“If it wasn’t for the garbage man making noise out there I wouldn’t be here,” Ruth told theTrail Times. “Even the front of my housecoat was singed. I couldn’t breathe very good and the back room was full of smoke,”she recounted. “So if it wasn’t for him, he helped me get out, I wouldn’t be here today.”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });The Alpine worker also called 9-1-1, and that report went into the regional fire hall just before 10:15 a.m. that Wednesday morning.BC Ambulance was called to the scene as well, and Ruth was transported to the hospital for treatment of smoke inhalation.She is still shaken, and since the terrifying ordeal, Ruth has been recovering at her son’s home in the Okanagan.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });“Thirty seconds more, or if the recycling man wasn’t there when she opened the door, it would be a different story,” her son, Chris Kaspick, told the Times.“Because her housecoat was already on fire, it was singed at the bottom, it was that close.”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });With his mom settled in safe and at his side, Chris has been taking care of the business end of things, such as calling the insurance company and getting the house restored from smoke damage.With the dust settled and residual shock starting to ease, Chris called theTrail Timesfrom his Okanagan home to pass on what happened.“After years of use, the husks in those bags can breakdown and become quite flammable,” he said. “And then, when it’s heated up and put on a couch that is made of foam, that becomes very flammable – it just smoldered while she was sleeping,” Chris explained. “So when the Alpine truck woke her up … and she cracked the back door open, as soon as the oxygen got it, it blew her back a bit and the oxygen set the fire.”Before sharing this story with theTimes, Chris had an even more important call to make, and that was to Alpine Disposal.He had to thank the man who saved his mother and try to get this worker some sort of commendation, or at least some well-deserved recognition for his life-saving actions.As the old saying goes, “Not All Heroes Wear Capes.”“He’s a humble guy and said he just wants to be known as the recycle guy who helped out, and he doesn’t want his name out,” Chris said, his own voice cracking with emotion.“All he said is, ‘if it was my mom, I wish somebody would do the same thing for her.’”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-57');gptRefreshSlots.push(57); });As Ruth readies to return home, one thing is clear, the terrifying experience did not steal her sense of humour.Most of all, she wanted to warn others that these heat packs can become a fire hazard.But Ruth also had one last thing to say.“Now that I know, I’ll just get an electric one,” she quipped.newsroom@trailtimes.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitterCity of TrailfireKootenay Boundary Regional DistrictSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/close-call-has-b-c-senior-warning-of-an-unexpected-fire-hazard/"

Staff made sure that Clara made Mary’s acquaintance.“The first thing Clara did was pinch Mary, 89, really hard,” said Sandy Parise, Eden Gardens’ executive assistant, in the release. “Mary yelped and Clara responded with, ‘I thought you were dead.’”The sisters, who had lost contact with one another six years earlier, couldn’t believe who they were seeing, Parise said, and spent the next several hours that day, and many more since, laughing together and talking a mile a minute while reminiscing.READ ALSO:Compassion and enthusiasm are at the centre of Eden Gardens’ approach to dementia careBill Newman, the sisters’ younger brother who lives on the Sunshine Coast, said the sisters lost touch after Clara had suffered a stroke and developed difficulties with comprehension. She lived in the Duncan area before requiring greater care, and Bill arranged for her to move into Eden Gardens.“She didn’t really know quite what was going on. I’ll put it that way,” Bill said, in a phone interview with the News Bulletin. “She didn’t quite understand what people were saying and she thought Mary didn’t want her to phone her again or see her again and that’s why they didn’t see one another, but it was just a total misunderstanding between the two of them.”Bill said Clara has mostly recovered from the effects of the stroke.He said his sisters have been reminiscing about growing up in Sansum Narrows, south of Maple Bay. They come from a large family of six sisters and five brothers and lived on a houseboat – named the ‘El Rose’ after their mother – until about 1948.“My grandfather used to sell mine props to the mines at Nanaimo and Mom and her sisters and brothers, they logged them, with horses … and they had to walk to Genoa Bay. Seven miles to work and then seven miles back and then they logged the poles during the day.”Some of the memories recalled at the sisters’ first meeting had the women laughing so hard they both had tears running down their cheeks.“Clara told us that Mary was always Daddy’s favourite,” Parise said. “It was so amusing to see Mary having so much fun. She is usually so reserved. At that moment, no one existed but the two of them as they shared some ice cream and chatted the afternoon away, while the staff shared tears of happiness enjoying the excitement.”READ ALSO:Eden Gardens’ calendar sure to be a chart-topperphotos@nanaimobulletin.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitterSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/sisters-surprised-to-find-themselves-reunited-at-nanaimo-seniors-care-home-after-years-apart/"

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the residents of the Mill Springs Village strata neighbourhood in Mill Bay have come up with a simple but potentially effective plan to use that tape to prevent those types of unfortunate events.“With the spread of COVID-19, there is concern that the most vulnerable within Mill Springs Village community may need assistance in the days and weeks ahead,” explained strata manager Melissa Ruyter. “As the situation unfolds, some of our residents may be reluctant, or unable to ask for help when help is needed.”That’s where the yellow caution tape comes in. Rolls of it have been placed at the four community mailboxes and residents are encouraged to tear off a two-foot strip and bring it home. The purpose?“If, in the times ahead, affected residents need urgent help acquiring medications, supplies, etc, place the yellow caution ribbon on your front door or somewhere it can be seen from the road. Write your phone number on the ribbon. Someone from the community will call and try to assist,” Ruyter explained.Community members out for a walk or driving by can keep an eye out and the community can look out for each other despite staying safely apart.The Shawnigan Lake RCMP has been notified of the initiative and will also keep an eye out during their patrols.SEE RELATED:Island doctor says health authority dropping the ball on COVID-19SEE RELATED:Coronavirus update: What’s happening right now in CanadaStrata council president Kevin Little said the council was just trying to come up with ways to help the community “in the midst of all this mess that’s going on.”With 267 homes in the strata development, not everybody knows their neighbours.“We are a community with a lot of seniors and a lot are single, a lot are terrified. How do we let them know they’re not alone?” Little said. “Not everybody has emails. Some seniors just don’t participate. We’ve asked everybody, if you have a neighbour who doesn’t use the internet or email to take the ribbon to them and explain [from a distance] how the program works.The yellow tape solution seemed easy enough.“It’s simple and it should work,” Little added. “I would hope other communities would pick up on it.

The challenge, however, is when you have older people who are at risk of social isolation — it’s very upsetting for them to be in isolation in many instances. And if you have people with cognitive impairment, they may not understand why no one is coming to visit them.”Ontario’s health ministry said Monday it was introducing “active surveillance” in which staff, volunteers, visitors and residents who come and go would be screened for symptoms and asked about travel history.In addition, any specimens sent for standard respiratory testing will automatically be tested for COVID-19, said a provincial memo to the long-term care homes sector.Chief medical officer of health Dr. David Williams stressed the need for the general public to take precautions that include washing hands frequently to protect the most vulnerable residents.“If people are casual about their travel protection, casual about their contact protection and are less than vigilant on staying home when they’re ill and that kind of thing, then we can put that population at risk,” he said.“By being vigilant, by keeping at that, you can protect them.”VIDEO:B.C. records first COVID-19 death in Canada as province hits 32 casesDoris Grinspun, chief executive officer of the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario, said Tuesday that she wanted assurances from the province that retirement homes would be held to the same guidelines.“It is my understanding from the ministry that they meant this to be also for retirement homes and we have asked that to be in writing,” said Grinspun.She also repeated her organization’s call for increased nursing-home staff, noting each facility typically has just one or two registered nurses, and three registered practical nurses.“The rest — 75 per cent of our workforce in nursing homes — are personal support workers (and) as much as they try to do what they can do, they don’t have the same expertise and knowledge and training as RNs or RPNs.

We don’t have the cleaning staff… We have no security. So if security was more who they thought would police this, there is no in security long-term care.”There are currently no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.In British Columbia, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says people should continue seeing their loved ones in nursing homes, but must take preventative measures.“We want to have enhanced screening of visitors who are coming in and out of long-term care (homes) so if you are going to visit someone don’t go with a large group, go one by one.

Assisted living is a type of supportive housing for people with moderate levels of disability who can direct their own care but need daily personal assistance in order to live independently, such as help getting dressed and bathing or assistance taking medications.Average annual rents for those private units range from just over $24,000 for an assisted living bachelor suite to more than $36,000 for a one bedroom, plus a myriad of additional fees for extra services and supplies not included in the basic monthly charge, according to report author Andrew Longhurst.Meanwhile, the median income for a single senior in the province is roughly $27,600.“Without access to subsidized assisted living, seniors who can’t afford to pay privately may go without care altogether or wait until their health deteriorates to the point of requiring a nursing home or hospitalization,” Longhurst said in a news release Wednesday.ALSO READ:Union pleas for province to act on nursing home takeover by Chinese government“This situation does not serve seniors or our public health care system well at all.”When compared to the growing population of seniors aged 75 years and older in B.C., the province saw a 17 per cent drop in the number of subsidized assisted living units between 2008 and 2017.In 2008, there were 4,393 publicly subsidized units for slightly more than 298,000 seniors in the province, or a rate of 14.7 per 1,000 seniors. But by 2017, according to the report, there were 4,485 units for roughly 367,000 seniors – a rate of 12.2.Region-by-region, four of the five health authorities saw declines during this time, including Vancouver Coastal Health (25 per cent decline), Fraser Health (19 per cent decline), Vancouver Island Health (17 per cent decline) and Interior Health (11 per cent decline).Vancouver Coastal Health had the lowest level of access with just 10 units per 1,000 seniors. Meanwhile, Northern Health saw a marginal increase in the number of units, at five per cent.Longhurst said another key concern is the rise in international companies owning seniors’ care facilities. Currently, the provincial government does not limit how much private operators can charge.“Allowing assisted living facilities to be treated as financial commodities is at odds with the basic social purpose of providing care to vulnerable seniors,” he said.“The absence of public capital investments to enable health authorities and non-profits to develop new spaces means very few new publicly subsidized assisted living facilities are being built. The private-pay market has benefited as a result.”The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives’s report makes two recommendations to the province: Increase government funding to open more assisted living units and implement detailed, public disclosure of all assisted living units including the cost, ownership and quality of services.The province is expected to unveil their next budget later this month.

For-profit care homes “failed to deliver 207,000 funded direct care home hours” during the survey period, while not-for-profit operators “exceeded direct care hour targets by delivering an additional 80,000 hours of direct care beyond what they were publicly funded to deliver,” the report finds.The report says the difference in spending is partly due to care aide wages in for-profit care homes, where they can be paid as much as 28 per cent or $6.63 per hour less than the industry standard.RELATED:B.C. seniors need better vaccine protection, advocate saysRELATED:Seniors Advocate finds holes in B.C. home supportBringing care home delivery hours up to the province’s own standard has been a major focus for Dix, along with expanding care provided directly by regional health authorities.Currently 33 per cent of publicly funded long-term care beds are operated by B.C.’s regional health authorities.

The people who come here value independence, dignity and quality of life. It’s our daily goal to ensure that happens.”Fleming got her start in business as a bookkeeper for a lumber company. Once the books were balanced, she’d head outside, hop on a forklift and tidy up the yard. Then she asked if she could tackle the RFPs that came in. She did and the company won the bid. After that her boss let her set up a sales office in in Port McNeill. She was loading a truck with a forklift in the snow one day and dumped the entire load on the ground. It was then she realized she wanted to get more into the business side of things and started the CGA program.In 1982 she met her husband and in 1983 they moved to Calgary. “The first job that got me recognition was with a computer company that had 11 offices across Canada. The promotions started when I fixed their inventory system.” Fleming moved up the ranks to Chief Accountant, then Controller and then CFO.By the fall of 1989 Fleming and her husband moved back to the West Shore. She started a business which morphed into an accounting company which her sister, Dana Adams (also a CPA) now runs.Fleming spent several years analysing company needs and helping them grow. She ended up with a real estate based company where she learned how to do land development. Markets changed and Fleming changed with them.In the early 2000s the Langford Legion asked her what they could do with their property that would generate income. “I did a presentation for senior’s housing and three weeks later they accepted. The community came together, and we built a highly successful residence that, while under our management, boasted a long wait list and very happy customers.”Some years ago Fleming met with the Elders of the Redeemer Lutheran Church. “They approached me about senior’s housing and the hopes of their congregation in a somewhat unique situation. After much research in the USA, Fleming was able to develop a viable business plan that met the criteria of the congregation and the financiers.”In 2012 Fleming and Adams signed the contract with Redeemer and in 2016 they purchased the land.“It took four years to raise the capital and our first resident moved into Cherish at Central Park in November 2017. We are pet friendly and have about 130 people living here now. We wanted an intergenerational residence and got that. The Lutheran Church is inside our building. They own their space and we own ours.”Fleming takes the responsibility of making a difference very seriously. “At Cherish we help people maintain their independence as they age. We get to know everyone who lives here and they get to know each other. We give the people here a voice. We listen as a group. The people who live here get things done. They raise funds for great causes. The self-confidence and sense of purpose that comes with that is very real. Creating this Cherish community is what I was meant to do.”When she’s not working, Fleming likes to unwind in nature. “I love being out on the water and I love the woods. I love flowers that attract hummingbirds and bees.”When asked what advice she would give to others starting out in business, she had this to say: “Take responsibility for what you do and where you go in life. You can’t let your history be an anchor. Anything you put your mind to is possible if you are willing to work for it.”Daily Uniform:Mostly business casual unless I’m working in the garden and I wear jeans.Favourite pair of shoes:Day to day, I love my black slip-ons with a small heel.

Seniors Advocate questions labour shortage in care homes,"B.C.’s health care budget has the biggest numbers of any provincial government function, but for seniors in residential care, the most important numbers are the small ones.A key one is, do they get one bath per week, or two?The standard for each senior in a provincially funded home is 3.36 hours of care per day, a target Health Minister Adrian Dix has pledged to meet by 2021 by adding operating money and staff to provincial and contracted care homes.Last year’s budget committed extra funds toward that goal, with $48.4 million in the current budget allocated to 183 facilities around the province for care aides, physiotherapists and other support staff. Dix has said that the key is to recruit 1,500 full-time equivalent people, 900 of them care aides, to fill the persistent service gap, after more than 800 care aides moved from part-time to full-time work.After the release of the B.C. budget this week, the problem was highlighted by Mike Klassen, vice president of the B.C. Care Providers Association. He called the ministry’s three-year staff funding commitment “extremely generous,” and noted that Finance Minister Carole James’ new budget adds additional money for training.RELATED:Only 15% of care homes met standard by 2018RELATED:Still too many seniors in care, or at home on drugs“We’re at full employment in B.C. right now, so what we’re seeing is a lot of care providers are really coming up short,” Klassen said. “So seniors are not getting the care they need because of those staffing shortages.”B.C. Seniors’ Advocate Isobel Mackenzie questions that conclusion. She said the latest budget confirms the health ministry’s three-year commitment to reach the care hours target, which was first made by the previous B.C. Liberal government.Mackenzie’s office did some checking in an effort to verify the labour shortage. The Health Employers Association maintains a “difficult-to-fill vacancy report,” and she said care aides are not on the list. And a check of job ads also came up empty.“The other thing that the industry doesn’t really want to talk about, but I think has to be talked about, is the wage differential,” Mackenzie said in an interview with Black Press. “If you’re going to say, ‘I can’t hire anybody but I’m going to pay $19 an hour,’ and down the street they’re paying $24 an hour and they are getting people, I think the solution to your problem is pretty obvious. Pay them 24 bucks an hour.”The Seniors Advocate office has tested results with regular surveys of seniors at home, in assisted living and in residential care, a process Mackenzie intends to expand.“We can say we’re funding a care facility for 3.36 hours, but we can’t verify that’s what they’re providing,” Mackenzie said. “We need a very robust monitoring mechanism in place to make sure that care operators who are receiving funds for care hours are using those to deliver those care hours.”@tomfletcherbctfletcher@blackpress.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.BC legislatureSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/b-c-seniors-advocate-questions-labour-shortage-in-care-homes/"

The report covers the 2017/18 fiscal year, ending March 31, 2018, which predates our government’s seniors plan, and the historic investment made in seniors care in Budget 2018.Our government is investing $1.048 billion over three years to improve care for seniors, including investments in primary care, home health, residential care, assisted living and respite services. The Seniors Advocate Report supports the government’s decision regarding implementing a substantial seniors strategy, and we will be referring to it in measuring the progress our plan.To address the increase in seniors waiting to attend adult day programs we are providing $75 million over the next three years to expand this. As an example, Island Health has planned for 7,400 more spaces. By increasing these spaces, we will help seniors continue living in their homes longer, delay or avoid moving to residential care, and will better support caregivers and give them the relief they need.A total of $240 million is being invested to increase direct care hours for seniors to an average of 3.36 hours per patient per day by 2021. More educational spaces for health-care assistants are being created across B.C. to help support this. And, through the Health Sector Statutes Repeal Act, continuity of care for seniors will improve with improved job security and stability for health care staff.We look forward to working with the Seniors Advocate to monitor and review how these investments in seniors are benefiting them, and to ensure the best of care.Adrian DixB.C.

140,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/opinion/b-c-views-seniors-home-worker-discrimination-finally-ending/,"Nov 11, 2018",B.C. VIEWS: Seniors home worker discrimination finally ending,"This column has been hard on the B.C. NDP government’s favours to big labour in recent weeks.Their union monopoly on public construction is a discriminatory sell-out that will be costing taxpayers for years to come, and the likely elimination of secret ballot votes is another bid to protect unions that are dwindling away in today’s global economy.But this week I’ll offer my appreciation to Health Minister Adrian Dix, who has won a battle he has been fighting for more than a decade, restoring union successor rights for employees of senior care homes and related jobs. This is to end “contract flipping,” where one contractor takes over from another and gets out from under the union agreement, usually with the Hospital Employees’ Union or the B.C. Government Employees’ Union.Here’s how BCGEU president Stephanie Smith explained the problem that has plagued one of the lowest-wage, female-dominated employment groups in the province since 2002:“The practice of contract flipping typically involves mass layoffs and forces workers to re-apply for jobs that they have, in many cases, already been performing for years. When this occurs, existing collective agreements and union representation are not carried over, and contracts offered by the new service provider typically offer lower wages, reduced benefits and weakened rights for employees. In short, contract flipping is a strategy for suppressing wages and weakening employee rights in the workplace.”Dix introduced legislation last week to repeal two provisions that survived the B.C. Liberal government’s long court battle with the HEU, making employees “second class citizens” as contract-flipping continued into this year.“There are care homes such as Inglewood on the North Shore and Nanaimo Seniors Village that have seen their contracts flipped multiple times,” Dix said. “In other words, work is contracted out, the workers come together, they organize a union, they negotiate with the employer, in this case the contractor. Then the contractor is changed, salaries are reduced and they have to go through the process again and again and again.”I recall the bitter debate when this move was made by a newly elected Gordon Campbell government with an overwhelming mandate, the NDP reduced to two East Vancouver seats. One B.C. Liberal MLA noted that under generous contracts signed with the previous NDP government, an HEU employee was entitled to a paid day off to take his or her dog to the veterinarian.No one at that time anticipated the repeated use of contract flipping in senior care homes, just as no one anticipated the sale of Retirement Concepts, a Vancouver-based chain of contract care homes, to a state-linked Chinese company that’s acquiring prime real estate around the world.What the Campbell government should have seen coming was that this crackdown on a ballooning health care budget came at the worst possible time for senior care. Baby boomers are stepping down, and breaking down, in huge numbers, and there aren’t enough people who will take care of them under the working conditions they face.Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie put numbers to it in B.C.’s first comprehensive survey of seniors homes last year. It showed that most don’t meet the province’s standard of just over three hours care per resident, per day. Help in the bathroom is one of the biggest shortages, and Dix estimates that another 900 care aides are needed to reach the standard.Not enough people are willing to do this job, and long-term workers are retiring themselves.Tom Fletcher is B.C. legislature reporter and columnist for Black Press Media.

Labour Relations Code, allowing them to avoid successor rights and common employer declarations when operation of a care home shifts from one contractor to another.The legislation led to thousands of care home employees being laid off and then offered their jobs back with reduced wages and benefits, Dix said.Repealing law will stop “contract flipping” in seniors care homes says@adriandix#bcpolipic.twitter.com/nlVXMqris0— Tom Fletcher (@tomfletcherbc)November 8, 2018“Fragmentation of health care delivery, the disruption of care relationships, and more precarious and lower-paid work is the direct result of these mean-spirited laws,” said Jennifer Whiteside, secretary-business manager of the HEU.Dix said Thursday the new provisions will not be implemented immediately, to allow the operators to adjust. Stability is urgently needed to attract more care aides and bring facilities up to the province’s standard of more than three hours per day of personal care per patient, he said.RELATED:Bathing, meal times need work, residential care survey findsCare aides provide “the most important personal care in the life of a senior,” and there are 29,000 currently in government and contracted care facilities, Dix said.

The rate has changed little in the past five years, despite Mackenzie’s focus on this problem.In care facilities, the number of residents reporting daily pain is also on the rise in B.C.“We need to be cautious around balancing pain control and use of opioid medications,” Mackenzie said.A likely related issue is that of “caregiver distress,” as family members and others struggle to cope with the needs of seniors with dementia, depression, diabetes and other conditions at home.“The good news is it has gone down 3.2 per cent, but is still up 34 per cent over five years, the second highest in Canada,” Mackenzie said.""we still have the highest percentage of home care clients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia (35.1% compared to 27.7% as the national average).""@SrsAdvocateBC— Tom Fletcher (@tomfletcherbc)September 20, 2018Another theme for the Seniors Advocate office has been the decline in B.C. home care resources to keep seniors at home with adequate supports.

Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie, the latest measure of performance of senior care.“After a careful review of multi-year data, a consistent pattern emerges that shows a demonstrably greater use of he emergency department and hospital beds by residents from contracted long-term care facilities versus residents from publicly run facilities, and a stunning 54 per cent greater likelihood that you will die in the hospital if you live in a contracted care facility versus a publicly operated facility,” Mackenzie said Wednesday.Analysis of hospital data showed that residents of contracted care homes were 32 per cent more likely to be sent to emergency, 34 per cent more likely to be admitted to hospital, spent more time in hospital and were 47 per cent more likely to be transferred to a different level of facility when released.The B.C. Care Providers’ Association, representing contracted care homes, disputed the findings. Association CEO Daniel Fontaine said the report does not determine how many of the higher rate of emergency visits were legitimate visits, and the report contains “questionable assumptions and political buzzwords, rather than independent research.”Health Minister Adrian Dix said in an interview the gap between public and private care home staffing occurred during the B.C. Liberal government, when 91 per cent of care homes didn’t meet provincial standard for direct care hours. The health care budget now includes a record increase intended to meet that standard, on average, in every health authority, he said.“I’m acting on care standards, I’m acting on more beds, I’m acting on improving supports in the community because we want fewer people going into care,” Dix said.There are 293 publicly subsidized care facilities in B.C., a third of which are directly operated by provincial health authorities. The rest are contracted with a mix of private companies and not-for-profit organizations.RELATED:Care home directory rates B.C. facilitiesPrevious studies by Mackenzie’s office have noted that contract care facilities are funded for fewer hours of direct care than public facilities, including physiotherapy, occupational and recreational therapy. They also are the subject of more complaints from residents and families.“We know that contracted facilities have more substantiated complaints and reportable incidents than public facilities,” the report states. “But in the recent province-wide satisfaction survey of all subsidized contracted and public care facilities in the province, there was no overall difference in the level of satisfaction and quality of life indicators between those facilities operated by a health authority (public) and those facilities operated by the contractors.”https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/contract-care-homes-mean-more-hospital-deaths-seniors-advocate/"

They are at risk of losing their jobs.”Whiteside points to Finnish Manor, a Burnaby facility where the owners laid off the entire staff of 50 last week, then contracted out the jobs with what she says are lower wages and benefits.B.C. Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie does annual surveys of care home service levels. Her latest report in January found 85 per cent of B.C.’s 293 publicly funded residential care homes don’t have enough staff to provide the 3.35 hours per patient per day that the health ministry sets as a standard.Mackenzie found that facilities owned and operated by regional health authorities are generally funded to meet the care hours, as well as higher rates of therapy and more physically dependent residents than contracted operators.Mike Klassen, communications director for the B.C. Care Providers’ Association, says the additional money is “good news for B.C. seniors.” But recruiting more staff is going to be challenging, as the government’s plan to expand child care creates additional demand on the same pool of employees needed by seniors’ homes.Whiteside says care aides need higher wages as well as an expectation of stable work.Health Minister Adrian Dix says 900 additional care aides are needed to meet the care standard across the province. The additional money allows health authorities to offer full-time work to part-time and casual employees.BC legislatureSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/bc-budget-new-money-helps-seniors-care-shortage/"
146,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/opinion/b-c-views-who-will-care-for-frail-elderly/,"Feb 4, 2018",B.C. VIEWS: Who will care for frail elderly?,"The B.C. NDP government has taken its first significant step to close the wide and persistent gap between the reality of basic support for seniors in residential care and the province’s target.Officially, that target is an average 3.36 hours of personal care per patient, per day. In practical terms, that means getting two baths a week instead of one, or being escorted with a walker to the dining room instead of being whisked there in a wheelchair by an overworked employee.In human terms, it means an isolated, lonely senior is not just cleaner and more comfortable, he or she gets a few more minutes of personal contact to relieve the tedium of confinement and the junk of daytime TV.B.C.’s Seniors Advocate, Isobel Mackenzie, reported last week that as of March 2017, that standard was being met in 15 per cent of publicly funded care homes. That’s up from nine-per-cent compliance the previous year, based on an annual survey of the 293 public and contracted care homes across the province.The first move was communicated to facility operators in conference calls last week, and will be confirmed in the NDP government budget on Feb. 20. Authorities will be funded to increase their casual and part-time care aide positions to full time as of April 1.Health Minister Adrian Dix cautions that this is at best a partial solution, even with half of the current workforce in casual and part-time positions. Not all will accept full-time work.“To reach the 3.36 [hours target], we’re told that it will require 900 net new care aides, in a sector where more than a quarter of care aides are over 55,” Dix told me. “So there would be considerable effort just to stay where we are now, and this is going to require a significant number of new care aides.”Daniel Fontaine, CEO of the B.C. Care Providers Association, agrees: “Moving from casual to full-time is not going to do it.”Fontaine has been pushing to expand dual-credit high school courses to get more young people into senior care as a first job, with virtually guaranteed employment even in rural and remote communities. These high school spaces are now mainly focused on male-dominated skilled trades, while popular culture bombards teens with the allure of high-tech careers.At a residential care conference in Surrey Jan. 26, Dix announced new post-secondary training spaces for care aides. Unfortunately, the government is also embarking on an aggressive expansion of child care, and the labour pool for that is largely the same people.Fontaine says he’s hearing regularly from private colleges around B.C. that have vacant health care assistant training spaces now. The fastest solution would be to fill those spaces with immigrants eager to work, but there’s a problem. Federal immigration authorities won’t issue work permits unless students train at a public college. So the province wastes money on duplicate public spaces due to Ottawa’s arbitrary rules.And of course the shortage of young workers mirrors the vast growth in seniors as baby boomers retire. There are currently 28,000 seniors in publicly funded residential care in B.C., out of an estimated 850,000 people over 65. Total senior population is projected to reach 1.4 million over the next 15 years.“But over 75, that number is going to increase by two and a half times in the next 20 years,” Dix said.Progress is slowly being made, thanks to the work of the Seniors Advocate’s office to report this situation to the public and to governments.Tom Fletcher is B.C. legislature reporter and columnist for Black Press.

Contracted facilities were funded for an average of 3.01 hours, and health authority owned and operated facilities averaged 3.35 hours, almost up the the B.C. government’s target.Jennifer Whiteside, secretary-business manager of the Hospital Employees’ Union, said Wednesday’s report is a familiar story of understaffed facilities in B.C, with 85 per cent of them still not meeting the government’s own standard.“When there are not enough staff on shift to do their jobs to the highest possible standard, seniors and those who provide their care are put at risk,” Whiteside said. “Staff simply cannot provide the level and quality of care needed to keep themselves and their residents safe.”https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/b-c-senior-care-improving-still-far-below-target/"

It will include a break in the middle where the tester will provide feedback about driving performance.What the province calls “enhanced road assessment” can be required due to a doctor’s report of a medical condition, a police report of an accident or reports of a previous on-road assessment.“The vast majority of B.C. seniors successfully pass the driver’s medical exam,” said Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s Seniors Advocate. “For those very few who are referred for further testing, the changes being implemented by RoadSafetyBC represent a major improvement from the past system and will make the process much less stressful for those seniors required to undertake the test.”RoadSafetyBC evaluated the driving fitness of 170,000 people in 2016, and 3,000 of them were referred for an ICBC reassessment. Of those, 1,000 completed the DriveABLE test.BC legislatureSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/b-c-seniors-to-get-new-driving-assessment/"
149,https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/b-c-ndp-tackles-residential-care-gap/,"Oct 28, 2017",NDP’s Adrian Dix tackles seniors’ residential care gap,"Health Minister Adrian Dix says he needs to find not only more residential care beds for increasingly frail seniors, but an additional 1,500 care aides to bring their care up to the province’s own standard.The NDP minister says the need is across the province, with baby boomers reaching retirement age and moving to B.C., people living longer and a residential care system that hasn’t kept up with demand. And it’s more than just increasing numbers. It’s memory loss, dementia and other chronic conditions of advanced age.“A lot of care homes in B.C. used to deal mainly in what you’d call intermediate care, but the acuity of patients across care homes in B.C. has gone up,” Dix said in an interview with Black Press.More publicly funded beds and staff mean hundreds of millions in additional dollars in the health care budget, which is approaching half of all provincial spending. The B.C. Liberal government succeeded in slowing the growth rate for health care spending, after Ottawa imposed a cap on transfer payments that were rising by six per cent each year. Dix is now dealing with the downside of that spending restraint.RELATED:B.C. Liberals promise better senior careB.C.’s Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie has been surveying the need, and one of her most startling findings is the number of seniors who aren’t receiving the province’s care standard of 3.36 care hours per day. For residential care, the standard means they might get two baths a week instead of one, or be allowed to use a walker to get to the dining room instead of being pushed there in a wheelchair to save time.“In reports by the Seniors Advocate, in reports by the ministry, it was discovered before the election that 90 per cent didn’t meet that standard, and that was a significant fact,” Dix said.Former health minister Terry Lake responded to Mackenzie’s findings with a pledge of $500 million more in the B.C. Liberals’ pre-election budget. Mackenzie also defined the staffing need as 1,500 more positions, and Dix has pledged to meet both of those goals in the first NDP budget in February.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });Taking over private bedsgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });One pressing area of need is Fraser Health, with the largest and fastest-growing population of B.C.’s five provincial health regions. In September, Fraser Health announced the addition of 20 beds at care homes in Chilliwack and 18 in Langley.These are not newly constructed beds, but private beds taken over by the public system, making residents eligible for subsidies based on their income and care needs.RELATED:New public beds added in Chilliwack“It does happen from time to time that we draw on surplus private beds in the community to increase our publicly funded bed stock,” Fraser Health spokesperson Tasleem Juma said in an interview. “It’s not unusual to look to our contractors and say, ‘if you’ve got private bed stock that is surplus, we would be interested in moving it to the public side’.”Fraser Health is also increasing resources for home care visits, to keep more seniors out of residential care as called for by Mackenzie. Another issue in urban areas is the soaring cost of housing, pushing seniors into care facilities because they can’t afford rent.Dix notes that these and other additional publicly funded beds are being funded to meet the hours of care standard.Families seeking vacanciesFor families looking for a space for a senior, the B.C. Care Providers’ Association has a website atmycarefinder.cathat tracks the inventory of subsidized and unsubsidized residential care.Membership in the association is voluntary, and members agree to abide by its code of ethics, including compliance with all regulations. The code calls for members to treat patients and families with courtesy and dignity, and “refrain from conduct that undermines the role of the association and the credibility of the sector.”Not all B.C. care homes are members.Workers want fair treatmentDix said recruiting care aides is difficult today, partly because of working conditions and the practice of contract care homes to reincorporate and rehire staff with new union contracts.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-56');gptRefreshSlots.push(56); });“I think it’s a serious problem,” Dix said. “It’s now not just a question of justice for workers and the flipping of contracts and the effect that has on care for seniors, but not respecting the sector is a genuine recruitment problem, a health human resources problem.”Dix vows to improve job security for care aides, and also work with the B.C. Care Providers Association in an “aggressive campaign” to recruit and retain the needed staff.B.C. Liberal critic Joan Isaacs says she is pressing Dix to get the additional funds promised by the previous government. She defends the practice of care homes reorganizing when taxpayer-subsidized public sector union benefits are too costly. With falling interest rates on safe investments, defined-benefit pensions have been eliminated in much of the private sector. Public sector unions battle to hold onto them.“The biggest challenge is union contracts where we have to fund the pensions and employee benefits, and that becomes a huge cost for the sector to bear,” Isaacs said. “And I think this is where we have to be mindful of what is the most important thing, and that is that we deliver some form of accountability to our seniors so that our care is being delivered, whether it’s private or public, in a manner where people have a quality of life and get the care and attention that they deserve.”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });– with files from Paul Henderson in ChilliwackBC legislatureSeniorshttps://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/b-c-ndp-tackles-residential-care-gap/"
